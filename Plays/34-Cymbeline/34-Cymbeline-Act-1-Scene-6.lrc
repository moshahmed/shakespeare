[00:00.39]	[The same. Another room in the palace.,]
[00:01.18]	[Enter IMOGEN]
[00:01.97]IMOGEN	A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
[00:04.80]	A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
[00:07.43]	That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!
[00:10.86]	My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
[00:14.21]	Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
[00:17.24]	As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
[00:20.53]	Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
[00:23.89]	How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
[00:27.24]	Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
[00:30.40]	[Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO]
[00:31.19]PISANIO	Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
[00:33.69]	Comes from my lord with letters.
[00:36.20]IACHIMO	Change you, madam?
[00:37.71]	The worthy Leonatus is in safety
[00:40.28]	And greets your highness dearly.
[00:42.78]	[Presents a letter]
[00:43.57]IMOGEN	Thanks, good sir:
[00:45.02]	You're kindly welcome.
[00:46.86]IACHIMO	[Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!
[00:50.35]	If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
[00:53.37]	She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
[00:56.14]	Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
[00:59.30]	Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
[01:01.93]	Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
[01:05.09]	Rather directly fly.
[01:06.80]IMOGEN	[Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
[01:10.16]	kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
[01:13.84]	him accordingly, as you value your trust--
[01:16.87]	LEONATUS.'
[01:17.86]	So far I read aloud:
[01:19.57]	But even the very middle of my heart
[01:22.40]	Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
[01:25.82]	You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
[01:28.52]	Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
[01:31.75]	In all that I can do.
[01:33.52]IACHIMO	Thanks, fairest lady.
[01:35.24]	What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
[01:38.59]	To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
[01:41.82]	Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
[01:45.11]	The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
[01:48.40]	Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
[01:51.36]	Partition make with spectacles so precious
[01:54.59]	'Twixt fair and foul?
[01:56.30]IMOGEN	What makes your admiration?
[01:58.47]IACHIMO	It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
[02:01.76]	'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
[02:05.25]	Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,
[02:08.74]	For idiots in this case of favour would
[02:11.77]	Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
[02:14.66]	Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
[02:17.76]	Should make desire vomit emptiness,
[02:20.45]	Not so allured to feed.
[02:22.36]IMOGEN	What is the matter, trow?
[02:24.34]IACHIMO	The cloyed will,
[02:25.79]	That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
[02:29.14]	Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb
[02:32.70]	Longs after for the garbage.
[02:34.93]IMOGEN	What, dear sir,
[02:36.25]	Thus raps you? Are you well?
[02:38.42]IACHIMO	Thanks, madam; well.
[02:40.00]	[To PISANIO]
[02:40.79]	Beseech you, sir, desire
[02:42.70]	My man's abode where I did leave him: he
[02:45.73]	Is strange and peevish.
[02:47.64]PISANIO	I was going, sir,
[02:49.09]	To give him welcome.
[02:50.80]	[Exit]
[02:51.59]IMOGEN	Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?
[02:55.01]IACHIMO	Well, madam.
[02:56.13]IMOGEN	Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
[02:58.96]IACHIMO	Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
[03:02.05]	So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
[03:04.95]	The Briton reveller.
[03:06.66]IMOGEN	When he was here,
[03:08.17]	He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
[03:11.20]	Not knowing why.
[03:12.65]IACHIMO	I never saw him sad.
[03:14.36]	There is a Frenchman his companion, one
[03:17.32]	An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
[03:20.68]	A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
[03:23.38]	The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
[03:27.00]	Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
[03:30.68]	Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
[03:34.11]	By history, report, or his own proof,
[03:36.80]	What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
[03:39.90]	But must be, will his free hours languish for
[03:43.25]	Assured bondage?'
[03:44.70]IMOGEN	Will my lord say so?
[03:46.41]IACHIMO	Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:
[03:49.84]	It is a recreation to be by
[03:52.07]	And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
[03:55.69]	Some men are much to blame.
[03:57.87]IMOGEN	Not he, I hope.
[03:59.18]IACHIMO	Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
[04:02.80]	Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
[04:06.09]	In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
[04:09.52]	Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
[04:12.48]	To pity too.
[04:13.66]IMOGEN	What do you pity, sir?
[04:15.44]IACHIMO	Two creatures heartily.
[04:17.35]IMOGEN	Am I one, sir?
[04:18.60]	You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
[04:21.89]	Deserves your pity?
[04:23.54]IACHIMO	Lamentable! What,
[04:24.98]	To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
[04:28.21]	I' the dungeon by a snuff?
[04:30.25]IMOGEN	I pray you, sir,
[04:31.63]	Deliver with more openness your answers
[04:34.66]	To my demands. Why do you pity me?
[04:37.23]IACHIMO	That others do--
[04:38.61]	I was about to say--enjoy your--But
[04:41.24]	It is an office of the gods to venge it,
[04:44.27]	Not mine to speak on 't.
[04:46.18]IMOGEN	You do seem to know
[04:47.89]	Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
[04:51.25]	Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
[04:54.67]	Than to be sure they do; for certainties
[04:57.70]	Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
[05:00.92]	The remedy then born--discover to me
[05:03.69]	What both you spur and stop.
[05:05.92]IACHIMO	Had I this cheek
[05:07.44]	To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
[05:10.73]	Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
[05:14.28]	To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
[05:17.38]	Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
[05:20.60]	Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
[05:23.70]	Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
[05:26.79]	That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
[05:30.21]	Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
[05:33.57]	With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
[05:36.46]	Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
[05:39.43]	That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
[05:42.72]	That all the plagues of hell should at one time
[05:46.27]	Encounter such revolt.
[05:48.11]IMOGEN	My lord, I fear,
[05:49.50]	Has forgot Britain.
[05:51.14]IACHIMO	And himself. Not I,
[05:52.72]	Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
[05:55.75]	The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
[05:59.17]	That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
[06:02.53]	Charms this report out.
[06:04.44]IMOGEN	Let me hear no more.
[06:06.15]IACHIMO	O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
[06:09.64]	With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
[06:12.67]	So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
[06:15.30]	Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd
[06:19.12]	With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
[06:22.47]	Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
[06:26.29]	That play with all infirmities for gold
[06:29.32]	Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
[06:33.07]	As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
[06:36.10]	Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
[06:39.26]	Recoil from your great stock.
[06:41.56]IMOGEN	Revenged!
[06:42.55]	How should I be revenged? If this be true,--
[06:45.64]	As I have such a heart that both mine ears
[06:48.87]	Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
[06:51.76]	How should I be revenged?
[06:53.80]IACHIMO	Should he make me
[06:55.38]	Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
[06:58.74]	Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
[07:01.57]	In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
[07:04.79]	I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
[07:07.89]	More noble than that runagate to your bed,
[07:11.05]	And will continue fast to your affection,
[07:14.14]	Still close as sure.
[07:15.85]IMOGEN	What, ho, Pisanio!
[07:17.30]IACHIMO	Let me my service tender on your lips.
[07:20.20]IMOGEN	Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
[07:23.09]	So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
[07:26.51]	Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
[07:30.07]	For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
[07:33.62]	Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
[07:36.65]	From thy report as thou from honour, and
[07:39.68]	Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
[07:42.51]	Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
[07:45.60]	The king my father shall be made acquainted
[07:48.89]	Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
[07:51.92]	A saucy stranger in his court to mart
[07:54.82]	As in a Romish stew and to expound
[07:57.52]	His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
[08:00.48]	He little cares for and a daughter who
[08:03.44]	He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!
[08:06.40]IACHIMO	O happy Leonatus! I may say
[08:08.57]	The credit that thy lady hath of thee
[08:11.47]	Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
[08:15.09]	Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
[08:18.18]	A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
[08:21.08]	Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
[08:24.44]	For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
[08:27.92]	I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
[08:31.15]	Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,
[08:34.44]	That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
[08:37.47]	The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
[08:40.36]	That he enchants societies into him;
[08:43.13]	Half all men's hearts are his.
[08:45.50]IMOGEN	You make amends.
[08:46.95]IACHIMO	He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
[08:49.97]	He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
[08:52.87]	More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
[08:55.90]	Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
[08:59.19]	To try your taking a false report; which hath
[09:02.55]	Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
[09:06.03]	In the election of a sir so rare,
[09:08.60]	Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
[09:12.02]	Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
[09:15.45]	Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
[09:18.80]IMOGEN	All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
[09:21.90]	for yours.
[09:22.95]IACHIMO	My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
[09:25.78]	To entreat your grace but in a small request,
[09:29.14]	And yet of moment to, for it concerns
[09:31.97]	Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
[09:35.06]	Are partners in the business.
[09:37.36]IMOGEN	Pray, what is't?
[09:38.75]IACHIMO	Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
[09:41.64]	The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
[09:45.13]	To buy a present for the emperor
[09:47.70]	Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
[09:50.86]	In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
[09:54.28]	Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
[09:57.70]	And I am something curious, being strange,
[10:00.80]	To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
[10:04.28]	To take them in protection?
[10:06.46]IMOGEN	Willingly;
[10:07.51]	And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
[10:10.80]	My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
[10:14.29]	In my bedchamber.
[10:15.80]IACHIMO	They are in a trunk,
[10:17.51]	Attended by my men: I will make bold
[10:20.28]	To send them to you, only for this night;
[10:23.31]	I must aboard to-morrow.
[10:25.28]IMOGEN	O, no, no.
[10:26.20]IACHIMO	Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
[10:29.16]	By lengthening my return. From Gallia
[10:31.99]	I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
[10:35.35]	To see your grace.
[10:36.93]IMOGEN	I thank you for your pains:
[10:39.10]	But not away to-morrow!
[10:41.01]IACHIMO	O, I must, madam:
[10:42.39]	Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
[10:45.68]	To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:
[10:49.11]	I have outstood my time; which is material
[10:52.27]	To the tender of our present.
[10:54.57]IMOGEN	I will write.
[10:55.82]	Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
[10:59.11]	And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.
[11:02.27]	[Exeunt]
