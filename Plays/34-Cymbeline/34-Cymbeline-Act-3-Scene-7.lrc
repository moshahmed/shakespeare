[00:00.96]	[Enter two Senators and Tribunes]
[00:01.60]First Senator	This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:
[00:04.05]	That since the common men are now in action
[00:06.72]	'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
[00:09.01]	And that the legions now in Gallia are
[00:11.41]	Full weak to undertake our wars against
[00:13.87]	The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
[00:16.37]	The gentry to this business. He creates
[00:18.77]	Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,
[00:21.28]	For this immediate levy, he commends
[00:23.52]	His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
[00:26.03]First Tribune	Is Lucius general of the forces?
[00:28.06]Second Senator	Ay.
[00:28.54]First Tribune	Remaining now in Gallia?
[00:30.14]First Senator	With those legions
[00:31.47]	Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
[00:34.03]	Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
[00:36.86]	Will tie you to the numbers and the time
[00:39.37]	Of their dispatch.
[00:40.65]First Tribune	We will discharge our duty.
[00:42.41]	[Exeunt]
