[00:00.42]	[Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.,]
[00:01.26]	[Enter CLOTEN and two Lords]
[00:02.10]CLOTEN	Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the
[00:06.09]	jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a
[00:09.60]	hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
[00:13.52]	must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine
[00:17.52]	oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
[00:21.65]First Lord	What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
[00:25.51]	your bowl.
[00:26.63]Second Lord	[Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it,
[00:30.49]	it would have run all out.
[00:32.73]CLOTEN	When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for
[00:36.79]	any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?
[00:40.02]Second Lord	No my lord;
[00:41.21]	[Aside]
[00:42.05]	nor crop the ears of them.
[00:44.30]CLOTEN	Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
[00:47.31]	Would he had been one of my rank!
[00:50.04]Second Lord	[Aside] To have smelt like a fool.
[00:52.71]CLOTEN	I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a
[00:56.49]	pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;
[01:00.14]	they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my
[01:04.20]	mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of
[01:07.78]	fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that
[01:11.84]	nobody can match.
[01:13.45]Second Lord	[Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
[01:17.10]	cock, with your comb on.
[01:19.13]CLOTEN	Sayest thou?
[01:20.39]Second Lord	It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
[01:24.39]	companion that you give offence to.
[01:27.26]CLOTEN	No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit
[01:30.84]	offence to my inferiors.
[01:32.94]Second Lord	Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
[01:35.89]CLOTEN	Why, so I say.
[01:37.22]First Lord	Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
[01:41.63]CLOTEN	A stranger, and I not know on't!
[01:44.23]Second Lord	[Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
[01:48.08]	not.
[01:48.78]First Lord	There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of
[01:52.50]	Leonatus' friends.
[01:54.11]CLOTEN	Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,
[01:57.61]	whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
[02:01.33]First Lord	One of your lordship's pages.
[02:03.78]CLOTEN	Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
[02:07.43]	derogation in't?
[02:08.97]Second Lord	You cannot derogate, my lord.
[02:11.35]CLOTEN	Not easily, I think.
[02:13.11]Second Lord	[Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your
[02:16.61]	issues, being foolish, do not derogate.
[02:19.62]CLOTEN	Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost
[02:23.34]	to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
[02:27.19]Second Lord	I'll attend your lordship.
[02:29.44]	[Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord]
[02:30.28]	That such a crafty devil as is his mother
[02:33.64]	Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
[02:37.22]	Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
[02:40.93]	Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
[02:44.30]	And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
[02:47.38]	Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,
[02:50.47]	Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
[02:53.90]	A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
[02:56.99]	More hateful than the foul expulsion is
[03:00.21]	Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
[03:03.50]	Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm
[03:07.29]	The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked
[03:10.72]	That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,
[03:14.51]	To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!
[03:18.22]	[Exit]
