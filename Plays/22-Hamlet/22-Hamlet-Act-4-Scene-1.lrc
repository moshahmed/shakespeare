[00:00.44]	[A room in the castle.,]
[00:01.33]	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,
[00:01.77]	+ and GUILDENSTERN]
[00:02.22]KING CLAUDIUS	There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
[00:06.52]	You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
[00:10.37]	Where is your son?
[00:12.15]QUEEN GERTRUDE	Bestow this place on us a little while.
[00:15.49]	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
[00:16.38]	Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
[00:19.94]KING CLAUDIUS	What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
[00:22.61]QUEEN GERTRUDE	Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
[00:26.17]	Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
[00:29.65]	Behind the arras hearing something stir,
[00:33.06]	Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
[00:36.40]	And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
[00:39.81]	The unseen good old man.
[00:42.03]KING CLAUDIUS	O heavy deed!
[00:43.44]	It had been so with us, had we been there:
[00:46.93]	His liberty is full of threats to all;
[00:50.19]	To you yourself, to us, to every one.
[00:53.23]	Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
[00:56.94]	It will be laid to us, whose providence
[01:00.27]	Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
[01:04.50]	This mad young man: but so much was our love,
[01:08.21]	We would not understand what was most fit;
[01:11.77]	But, like the owner of a foul disease,
[01:14.95]	To keep it from divulging, let it feed
[01:18.22]	Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
[01:21.77]QUEEN GERTRUDE	To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
[01:25.04]	O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
[01:28.52]	Among a mineral of metals base,
[01:31.26]	Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
[01:34.97]KING CLAUDIUS	O Gertrude, come away!
[01:36.97]	The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
[01:40.68]	But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
[01:44.54]	We must, with all our majesty and skill,
[01:47.87]	Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
[01:51.58]	[Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
[01:52.47]	Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
[01:56.40]	Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
[01:59.66]	And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
[02:03.74]	Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
[02:07.59]	Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
[02:11.08]	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
[02:11.97]	Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
[02:15.90]	And let them know, both what we mean to do,
[02:19.46]	And what's untimely done [ ]
[02:22.20]	Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
[02:25.61]	As level as the cannon to his blank,
[02:28.73]	Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,
[02:32.65]	And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
[02:35.92]	My soul is full of discord and dismay.
[02:39.18]	[Exeunt]
