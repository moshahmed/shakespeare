[00:00.40]	[A room in Polonius' house.,]
[00:01.20]	[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA]
[00:02.00]LAERTES	My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
[00:04.88]	And, sister, as the winds give benefit
[00:07.75]	And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
[00:10.63]	But let me hear from you.
[00:12.70]OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?
[00:14.31]LAERTES	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
[00:17.52]	Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
[00:20.40]	A violet in the youth of primy nature,
[00:23.34]	Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
[00:26.42]	The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
[00:29.96]OPHELIA	No more but so?
[00:31.37]LAERTES	Think it no more;
[00:32.91]	For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
[00:35.98]	In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
[00:39.26]	The inward service of the mind and soul
[00:42.34]	Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
[00:45.62]	And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
[00:48.76]	The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
[00:51.90]	His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
[00:55.38]	For he himself is subject to his birth:
[00:58.39]	He may not, as unvalued persons do,
[01:01.07]	Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
[01:04.41]	The safety and health of this whole state;
[01:07.62]	And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
[01:11.17]	Unto the voice and yielding of that body
[01:14.31]	Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
[01:18.19]	It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
[01:21.34]	As he in his particular act and place
[01:24.28]	May give his saying deed; which is no further
[01:27.69]	Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
[01:30.97]	Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
[01:34.38]	If with too credent ear you list his songs,
[01:37.66]	Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
[01:41.27]	To his unmaster'd importunity.
[01:43.68]	Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
[01:46.69]	And keep you in the rear of your affection,
[01:49.97]	Out of the shot and danger of desire.
[01:52.84]	The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
[01:55.72]	If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
[01:58.60]	Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
[02:01.94]	The canker galls the infants of the spring,
[02:05.22]	Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
[02:08.43]	And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
[02:11.51]	Contagious blastments are most imminent.
[02:14.59]	Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
[02:17.53]	Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
[02:20.94]OPHELIA	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
[02:24.28]	As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
[02:27.63]	Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
[02:30.51]	Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
[02:33.78]	Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
[02:37.13]	Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
[02:40.61]	And recks not his own rede.
[02:42.81]LAERTES	O, fear me not.
[02:44.15]	I stay too long: but here my father comes.
[02:47.30]	[Enter POLONIUS]
[02:48.10]	A double blessing is a double grace,
[02:50.91]	Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
[02:53.72]LORD POLONIUS	Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
[02:56.86]	The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
[03:00.14]	And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
[03:03.95]	And these few precepts in thy memory
[03:06.83]	See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
[03:10.37]	Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
[03:13.38]	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
[03:16.46]	Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
[03:20.14]	Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
[03:23.55]	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
[03:26.90]	Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
[03:30.31]	Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
[03:33.25]	Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
[03:36.53]	Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
[03:39.67]	Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
[03:43.35]	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
[03:46.30]	But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
[03:49.51]	For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
[03:52.45]	And they in France of the best rank and station
[03:56.06]	Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
[03:59.68]	Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
[04:02.42]	For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
[04:05.63]	And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
[04:08.84]	This above all: to thine ownself be true,
[04:11.92]	And it must follow, as the night the day,
[04:14.99]	Thou canst not then be false to any man.
[04:18.07]	Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
[04:21.22]LAERTES	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
[04:24.23]LORD POLONIUS	The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
[04:27.50]LAERTES	Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
[04:30.25]	What I have said to you.
[04:32.25]OPHELIA	'Tis in my memory lock'd,
[04:34.26]	And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
[04:37.47]LAERTES	Farewell.
[04:38.47]	[Exit]
[04:39.28]LORD POLONIUS	What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
[04:42.22]OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
[04:45.90]LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:
[04:47.71]	'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
[04:50.58]	Given private time to you; and you yourself
[04:53.86]	Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
[04:57.67]	If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
[05:00.21]	And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
[05:03.49]	You do not understand yourself so clearly
[05:06.70]	As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
[05:09.91]	What is between you? give me up the truth.
[05:13.06]OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
[05:16.27]	Of his affection to me.
[05:18.21]LORD POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
[05:21.49]	Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
[05:24.50]	Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
[05:27.84]OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
[05:31.05]LORD POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
[05:34.33]	That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
[05:37.88]	Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
[05:41.69]	Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
[05:45.03]	Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
[05:48.11]OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importuned me with love
[05:51.19]	In honourable fashion.
[05:53.06]LORD POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
[05:56.07]OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
[05:59.75]	With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
[06:02.83]LORD POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
[06:05.97]	When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
[06:09.25]	Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
[06:12.59]	Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
[06:15.94]	Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
[06:19.02]	You must not take for fire. From this time
[06:22.23]	Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
[06:25.57]	Set your entreatments at a higher rate
[06:28.58]	Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
[06:31.72]	Believe so much in him, that he is young
[06:34.80]	And with a larger tether may he walk
[06:37.68]	Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
[06:40.55]	Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
[06:43.97]	Not of that dye which their investments show,
[06:47.38]	But mere implorators of unholy suits,
[06:50.25]	Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
[06:53.47]	The better to beguile. This is for all:
[06:56.41]	I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
[07:00.02]	Have you so slander any moment leisure,
[07:03.03]	As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
[07:06.51]	Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
[07:09.45]OPHELIA	I shall obey, my lord.
[07:11.26]	[Exeunt]
