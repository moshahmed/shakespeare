[00:00.41]	[Another part of the platform.,]
[00:01.24]	[Enter GHOST and HAMLET]
[00:02.08]HAMLET	Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
[00:05.89]Ghost	Mark me.
[00:06.86]HAMLET	I will.
[00:07.76]Ghost	My hour is almost come,
[00:09.77]	When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
[00:13.17]	Must render up myself.
[00:15.11]HAMLET	Alas, poor ghost!
[00:16.64]Ghost	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
[00:19.90]	To what I shall unfold.
[00:21.91]HAMLET	Speak; I am bound to hear.
[00:24.06]Ghost	So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
[00:27.52]HAMLET	What?
[00:28.29]Ghost	I am thy father's spirit,
[00:30.43]	Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
[00:33.90]	And for the day confined to fast in fires,
[00:37.23]	Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
[00:40.90]	Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
[00:44.58]	To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
[00:47.70]	I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
[00:51.03]	Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
[00:54.77]	Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
[00:58.93]	Thy knotted and combined locks to part
[01:02.05]	And each particular hair to stand on end,
[01:05.31]	Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
[01:08.50]	But this eternal blazon must not be
[01:11.41]	To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
[01:14.88]	If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
[01:18.07]HAMLET	O God!
[01:18.90]Ghost	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
[01:22.30]HAMLET	Murder!
[01:23.20]Ghost	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
[01:26.25]	But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
[01:29.51]HAMLET	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
[01:33.12]	As meditation or the thoughts of love,
[01:36.17]	May sweep to my revenge.
[01:38.25]Ghost	I find thee apt;
[01:39.77]	And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
[01:43.38]	That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
[01:46.64]	Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
[01:50.24]	'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
[01:53.57]	A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
[01:57.25]	Is by a forged process of my death
[02:00.09]	Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
[02:03.28]	The serpent that did sting thy father's life
[02:06.82]	Now wears his crown.
[02:08.62]HAMLET	O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
[02:11.05]Ghost	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
[02:14.30]	With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
[02:18.12]	O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
[02:21.52]	So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
[02:24.57]	The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
[02:27.96]	O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
[02:31.02]	From me, whose love was of that dignity
[02:34.14]	That it went hand in hand even with the vow
[02:37.60]	I made to her in marriage, and to decline
[02:40.86]	Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
[02:44.33]	To those of mine!
[02:45.92]	But virtue, as it never will be moved,
[02:48.90]	Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
[02:52.51]	So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
[02:55.77]	Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
[02:58.68]	And prey on garbage.
[03:00.48]	But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
[03:03.81]	Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
[03:07.21]	My custom always of the afternoon,
[03:09.98]	Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
[03:12.90]	With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
[03:16.02]	And in the porches of my ears did pour
[03:19.14]	The leperous distilment; whose effect
[03:22.12]	Holds such an enmity with blood of man
[03:25.24]	That swift as quicksilver it courses through
[03:28.77]	The natural gates and alleys of the body,
[03:32.03]	And with a sudden vigour doth posset
[03:35.01]	And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
[03:38.20]	The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
[03:41.67]	And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
[03:44.79]	Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
[03:48.40]	All my smooth body.
[03:50.13]	Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
[03:53.32]	Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
[03:56.86]	Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
[03:59.98]	Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
[04:02.68]	No reckoning made, but sent to my account
[04:05.94]	With all my imperfections on my head:
[04:08.92]	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
[04:11.83]	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
[04:15.02]	Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
[04:17.94]	A couch for luxury and damned incest.
[04:20.92]	But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
[04:23.90]	Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
[04:27.43]	Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
[04:30.97]	And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
[04:34.44]	To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
[04:38.04]	The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
[04:41.30]	And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
[04:44.35]	Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
[04:46.92]	[Exit]
[04:47.75]HAMLET	O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
[04:51.15]	And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
[04:54.96]	And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
[04:58.08]	But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
[05:01.06]	Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
[05:04.60]	In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
[05:07.72]	Yea, from the table of my memory
[05:10.36]	I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
[05:13.55]	All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
[05:17.22]	That youth and observation copied there;
[05:20.41]	And thy commandment all alone shall live
[05:23.67]	Within the book and volume of my brain,
[05:26.79]	Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
[05:29.98]	O most pernicious woman!
[05:32.06]	O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
[05:35.32]	My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
[05:38.16]	That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
[05:41.77]	At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
[05:45.09]	[Writing]
[05:45.93]	So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
[05:48.98]	It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
[05:51.47]	I have sworn 't.
[05:52.93]MARCELLUS	|
[05:53.35]	| [Within] My lord, my lord,--
[05:55.29]HORATIO	|
[05:55.70]MARCELLUS	[Within]
[05:56.54]	Lord Hamlet,--
[05:57.78]HORATIO	[Within]
[05:58.62]	Heaven secure him!
[06:00.28]HAMLET	So be it!
[06:01.32]HORATIO	[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
[06:03.54]HAMLET	Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
[06:06.10]	[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
[06:06.94]MARCELLUS	How is't, my noble lord?
[06:08.95]HORATIO	What news, my lord?
[06:10.61]HAMLET	O, wonderful!
[06:11.86]HORATIO	Good my lord, tell it.
[06:13.73]HAMLET	No; you'll reveal it.
[06:15.53]HORATIO	Not I, my lord, by heaven.
[06:17.61]MARCELLUS	Nor I, my lord.
[06:19.00]HAMLET	How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
[06:22.88]	But you'll be secret?
[06:24.76]HORATIO	|
[06:25.17]	| Ay, by heaven, my lord.
[06:27.04]MARCELLUS	|
[06:27.46]HAMLET	There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
[06:31.20]	But he's an arrant knave.
[06:33.35]HORATIO	There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
[06:37.17]	To tell us this.
[06:38.69]HAMLET	Why, right; you are i' the right;
[06:41.19]	And so, without more circumstance at all,
[06:44.38]	I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
[06:47.78]	You, as your business and desire shall point you;
[06:51.52]	For every man has business and desire,
[06:54.57]	Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
[06:57.83]	Look you, I'll go pray.
[06:59.77]HORATIO	These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
[07:03.38]HAMLET	I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
[07:06.22]	Yes, 'faith heartily.
[07:07.95]HORATIO	There's no offence, my lord.
[07:10.24]HAMLET	Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
[07:13.57]	And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
[07:17.25]	It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
[07:20.64]	For your desire to know what is between us,
[07:24.04]	O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
[07:27.58]	As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
[07:30.84]	Give me one poor request.
[07:32.99]HORATIO	What is't, my lord? we will.
[07:35.20]HAMLET	Never make known what you have seen to-night.
[07:38.74]HORATIO	|
[07:39.16]	| My lord, we will not.
[07:40.96]MARCELLUS	|
[07:41.38]HAMLET	Nay, but swear't.
[07:42.90]HORATIO	In faith,
[07:43.94]	My lord, not I.
[07:45.33]MARCELLUS	Nor I, my lord, in faith.
[07:47.34]HAMLET	Upon my sword.
[07:48.73]MARCELLUS	We have sworn, my lord, already.
[07:51.22]HAMLET	Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
[07:53.58]Ghost	[Beneath] Swear.
[07:54.83]HAMLET	Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
[07:58.02]	truepenny?
[07:59.13]	Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
[08:02.73]	Consent to swear.
[08:04.33]HORATIO	Propose the oath, my lord.
[08:06.48]HAMLET	Never to speak of this that you have seen,
[08:09.80]	Swear by my sword.
[08:11.47]Ghost	[Beneath] Swear.
[08:12.72]HAMLET	Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
[08:16.05]	Come hither, gentlemen,
[08:17.99]	And lay your hands again upon my sword:
[08:21.11]	Never to speak of this that you have heard,
[08:24.50]	Swear by my sword.
[08:26.17]Ghost	[Beneath] Swear.
[08:27.42]HAMLET	Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
[08:31.30]	A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
[08:34.91]HORATIO	O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
[08:38.44]HAMLET	And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
[08:41.91]	There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
[08:45.79]	Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
[08:49.47]	Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
[08:52.59]	How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
[08:55.78]	As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
[08:59.10]	To put an antic disposition on,
[09:01.67]	That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
[09:05.21]	With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
[09:08.67]	Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
[09:12.00]	As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
[09:15.75]	Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
[09:19.77]	Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
[09:22.75]	That you know aught of me: this not to do,
[09:26.01]	So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
[09:30.03]Ghost	[Beneath] Swear.
[09:31.28]HAMLET	Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
[09:33.57]	[They swear]
[09:34.40]	So, gentlemen,
[09:35.72]	With all my love I do commend me to you:
[09:38.91]	And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
[09:41.82]	May do, to express his love and friending to you,
[09:45.56]	God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
[09:49.38]	And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
[09:52.77]	The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
[09:55.96]	That ever I was born to set it right!
[09:58.94]	Nay, come, let's go together.
[10:01.23]	[Exeunt]
