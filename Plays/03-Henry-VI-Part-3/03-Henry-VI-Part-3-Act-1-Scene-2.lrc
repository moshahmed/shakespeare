[00:00.35]	[Sandal Castle.,]
[00:01.06]	[Enter RICHARD, EDWARD, and MONTAGUE]
[00:01.77]RICHARD	Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
[00:04.67]EDWARD	No, I can better play the orator.
[00:06.92]MONTAGUE	But I have reasons strong and forcible.
[00:09.59]	[Enter YORK]
[00:10.30]YORK	Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
[00:13.08]	What is your quarrel? how began it first?
[00:15.81]EDWARD	No quarrel, but a slight contention.
[00:18.23]YORK	About what?
[00:19.24]RICHARD	About that which concerns your grace and us;
[00:22.20]	The crown of England, father, which is yours.
[00:25.10]YORK	Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
[00:27.65]RICHARD	Your right depends not on his life or death.
[00:30.61]EDWARD	Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
[00:33.34]	By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
[00:36.65]	It will outrun you, father, in the end.
[00:39.20]YORK	I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
[00:42.16]EDWARD	But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
[00:44.94]	I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
[00:48.20]RICHARD	No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
[00:51.16]YORK	I shall be, if I claim by open war.
[00:53.53]RICHARD	I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
[00:56.73]YORK	Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
[00:59.21]RICHARD	An oath is of no moment, being not took
[01:01.88]	Before a true and lawful magistrate,
[01:04.37]	That hath authority over him that swears:
[01:07.15]	Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
[01:09.82]	Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
[01:12.78]	Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
[01:15.50]	Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
[01:18.34]	How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
[01:21.07]	Within whose circuit is Elysium
[01:23.32]	And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
[01:26.16]	Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
[01:28.65]	Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
[01:31.43]	Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
[01:34.39]YORK	Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
[01:36.94]	Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
[01:39.60]	And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
[01:42.27]	Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
[01:45.11]	And tell him privily of our intent.
[01:47.54]	You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
[01:50.08]	With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
[01:53.10]	In them I trust; for they are soldiers,
[01:55.71]	Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
[01:58.38]	While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
[02:01.45]	But that I seek occasion how to rise,
[02:04.00]	And yet the king not privy to my drift,
[02:06.67]	Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
[02:09.03]	[Enter a Messenger]
[02:09.75]	But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?
[02:12.94]Messenger	The queen with all the northern earls and lords
[02:16.14]	Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
[02:18.98]	She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
[02:21.71]	And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
[02:24.43]YORK	Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
[02:27.99]	Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
[02:30.83]	My brother Montague shall post to London:
[02:33.61]	Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
[02:36.22]	Whom we have left protectors of the king,
[02:39.00]	With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
[02:41.90]	And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
[02:44.69]MONTAGUE	Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
[02:47.35]	And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
[02:50.07]	[Exit]
[02:50.78]	[Enter JOHN MORTIMER and HUGH MORTIMER]
[02:51.50]	Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
[02:54.40]	You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
[02:57.06]	The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
[02:59.85]JOHN MORTIMER	She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
[03:02.98]YORK	What, with five thousand men?
[03:05.00]RICHARD	Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
[03:07.66]	A woman's general; what should we fear?
[03:10.27]	[A march afar off]
[03:10.98]EDWARD	I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
[03:14.06]	And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
[03:17.08]YORK	Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
[03:20.04]	I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
[03:22.35]	Many a battle have I won in France,
[03:24.78]	When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
[03:27.44]	Why should I not now have the like success?
[03:30.34]	[Alarum. Exeunt]
