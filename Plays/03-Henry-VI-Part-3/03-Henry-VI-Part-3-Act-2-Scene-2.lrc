[00:00.37]	[Before York.,]
[00:01.11]	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,
[00:01.48]	+ PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with
[00:01.85]	+ drum and trumpets]
[00:02.23]QUEEN MARGARET	Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
[00:05.26]	Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
[00:07.93]	That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
[00:11.15]	Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
[00:14.31]KING HENRY VI	Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
[00:17.72]	To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
[00:20.51]	Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
[00:23.55]	Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
[00:26.27]CLIFFORD	My gracious liege, this too much lenity
[00:29.06]	And harmful pity must be laid aside.
[00:31.67]	To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
[00:34.58]	Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
[00:37.68]	Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
[00:40.84]	Not his that spoils her young before her face.
[00:44.06]	Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
[00:47.29]	Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
[00:50.14]	The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
[00:53.30]	And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
[00:56.64]	Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
[00:59.43]	Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
[01:02.47]	He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
[01:05.32]	And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
[01:08.11]	Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
[01:11.09]	Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
[01:13.81]	Which argued thee a most unloving father.
[01:16.73]	Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
[01:19.58]	And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
[01:22.86]	Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
[01:25.65]	Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
[01:28.81]	Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
[01:32.28]	Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
[01:35.57]	Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
[01:38.85]	For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
[01:41.95]	Were it not pity that this goodly boy
[01:44.68]	Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
[01:48.09]	And long hereafter say unto his child,
[01:50.81]	'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
[01:54.16]	My careless father fondly gave away'?
[01:56.76]	Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
[01:59.74]	And let his manly face, which promiseth
[02:02.53]	Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
[02:05.56]	To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
[02:08.85]KING HENRY VI	Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
[02:11.82]	Inferring arguments of mighty force.
[02:14.43]	But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
[02:17.46]	That things ill-got had ever bad success?
[02:20.38]	And happy always was it for that son
[02:23.04]	Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
[02:26.08]	I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
[02:29.12]	And would my father had left me no more!
[02:31.97]	For all the rest is held at such a rate
[02:34.82]	As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
[02:37.92]	Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
[02:40.71]	Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
[02:43.99]	How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
[02:47.09]QUEEN MARGARET	My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
[02:50.44]	And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
[02:53.85]	You promised knighthood to our forward son:
[02:56.88]	Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
[02:59.92]	Edward, kneel down.
[03:01.41]KING HENRY VI	Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
[03:03.89]	And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.
[03:07.11]PRINCE	My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
[03:09.96]	I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
[03:12.69]	And in that quarrel use it to the death.
[03:15.54]CLIFFORD	Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
[03:18.39]	[Enter a Messenger]
[03:19.13]Messenger	Royal commanders, be in readiness:
[03:21.55]	For with a band of thirty thousand men
[03:24.34]	Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
[03:27.32]	And in the towns, as they do march along,
[03:30.17]	Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
[03:32.96]	Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
[03:35.93]CLIFFORD	I would your highness would depart the field:
[03:39.09]	The queen hath best success when you are absent.
[03:42.44]QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
[03:45.54]KING HENRY VI	Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
[03:48.76]NORTHUMBERLAND	Be it with resolution then to fight.
[03:51.36]PRINCE EDWARD	My royal father, cheer these noble lords
[03:54.21]	And hearten those that fight in your defence:
[03:57.37]	Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
[04:00.85]	[March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK,
[04:01.22]	+ NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers]
[04:01.59]EDWARD	Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
[04:04.75]	And set thy diadem upon my head;
[04:07.11]	Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
[04:09.96]QUEEN MARGARET	Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
[04:12.81]	Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
[04:15.72]	Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
[04:18.63]EDWARD	I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
[04:21.55]	I was adopted heir by his consent:
[04:24.03]	Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
[04:27.06]	You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
[04:30.29]	Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
[04:33.20]	To blot out me, and put his own son in.
[04:35.93]CLIFFORD	And reason too:
[04:37.23]	Who should succeed the father but the son?
[04:40.20]RICHARD	Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
[04:42.99]CLIFFORD	Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
[04:45.97]	Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
[04:48.51]RICHARD	'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
[04:51.73]CLIFFORD	Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
[04:54.46]RICHARD	For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
[04:57.68]WARWICK	What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
[05:01.09]QUEEN MARGARET	Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
[05:04.44]	When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
[05:07.35]	Your legs did better service than your hands.
[05:10.51]WARWICK	Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
[05:13.55]CLIFFORD	You said so much before, and yet you fled.
[05:16.46]WARWICK	'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
[05:19.68]NORTHUMBERLAND	No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
[05:22.84]RICHARD	Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
[05:25.57]	Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
[05:28.79]	The execution of my big-swoln heart
[05:31.40]	Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
[05:34.43]CLIFFORD	I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
[05:37.47]RICHARD	Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
[05:40.51]	As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
[05:43.73]	But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
[05:46.89]KING HENRY VI	Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
[05:50.24]QUEEN MARGARET	Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
[05:53.28]KING HENRY VI	I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
[05:56.00]	I am a king, and privileged to speak.
[05:58.61]CLIFFORD	My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
[06:01.89]	Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
[06:04.99]RICHARD	Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
[06:07.66]	By him that made us all, I am resolved
[06:10.38]	that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
[06:13.54]EDWARD	Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
[06:16.27]	A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
[06:19.43]	That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
[06:22.90]WARWICK	If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
[06:25.69]	For York in justice puts his armour on.
[06:28.48]PRINCE EDWARD	If that be right which Warwick says is right,
[06:31.64]	There is no wrong, but every thing is right.
[06:34.68]RICHARD	Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
[06:37.59]	For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
[06:40.75]QUEEN MARGARET	But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
[06:43.79]	But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
[06:46.45]	Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
[06:49.18]	As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
[06:52.16]RICHARD	Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
[06:54.82]	Whose father bears the title of a king,--
[06:57.61]	As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
[07:00.52]	Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
[07:04.06]	To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
[07:07.22]EDWARD	A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
[07:10.38]	To make this shameless callet know herself.
[07:13.41]	Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
[07:16.33]	Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
[07:18.99]	And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
[07:21.97]	By that false woman, as this king by thee.
[07:24.88]	His father revell'd in the heart of France,
[07:27.92]	And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
[07:31.14]	And had he match'd according to his state,
[07:34.12]	He might have kept that glory to this day;
[07:37.09]	But when he took a beggar to his bed,
[07:39.76]	And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
[07:42.92]	Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
[07:46.26]	That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
[07:49.73]	And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
[07:52.65]	For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
[07:56.06]	Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
[07:59.34]	And we, in pity of the gentle king,
[08:01.82]	Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
[08:04.67]GEORGE	But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
[08:07.83]	And that thy summer bred us no increase,
[08:10.68]	We set the axe to thy usurping root;
[08:13.29]	And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
[08:16.70]	Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
[08:19.79]	We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
[08:23.02]	Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
[08:26.18]EDWARD	And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
[08:28.72]	Not willing any longer conference,
[08:31.20]	Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
[08:34.30]	Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
[08:37.33]	And either victory, or else a grave.
[08:39.88]QUEEN MARGARET	Stay, Edward.
[08:40.99]EDWARD	No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
[08:43.84]	These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
[08:47.31]	[Exeunt]
