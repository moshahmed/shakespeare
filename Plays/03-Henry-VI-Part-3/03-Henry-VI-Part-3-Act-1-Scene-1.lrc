[00:10.55]	[London. The Parliament-house.,]
[00:31.65]	[Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK,
[00:42.20]	+ MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers]
[00:51.00]WARWICK	I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
[00:53.99]YORK	While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
[00:57.17]	He slily stole away and left his men:
[00:59.97]	Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
[01:03.02]	Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
[01:06.34]	Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
[01:09.39]	Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
[01:12.64]	Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
[01:16.15]	Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
[01:19.41]EDWARD	Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
[01:22.53]	Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
[01:25.45]	I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
[01:28.51]	That this is true, father, behold his blood.
[01:31.63]MONTAGUE	And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
[01:35.20]	Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
[01:38.26]RICHARD	Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
[01:41.44]	[Throwing down SOMERSET's head]
[01:42.22]YORK	Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
[01:45.34]	But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
[01:48.53]NORFOLK	Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
[01:51.85]RICHARD	Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
[01:54.97]WARWICK	And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
[01:57.83]	Before I see thee seated in that throne
[02:00.82]	Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
[02:03.81]	I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
[02:07.12]	This is the palace of the fearful king,
[02:10.05]	And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
[02:13.04]	For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
[02:16.36]YORK	Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
[02:19.35]	For hither we have broken in by force.
[02:22.21]NORFOLK	We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
[02:25.52]YORK	Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
[02:28.64]	And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
[02:31.96]	[They go up]
[02:32.74]WARWICK	And when the king comes, offer no violence,
[02:35.86]	Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
[02:38.98]YORK	The queen this day here holds her parliament,
[02:42.29]	But little thinks we shall be of her council:
[02:45.61]	By words or blows here let us win our right.
[02:48.86]RICHARD	Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
[02:52.18]WARWICK	The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
[02:55.36]	Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
[02:58.35]	And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
[03:01.47]	Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
[03:04.27]YORK	Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
[03:07.19]	I mean to take possession of my right.
[03:10.05]WARWICK	Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
[03:13.31]	The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
[03:16.30]	Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
[03:19.61]	I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
[03:22.93]	Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
[03:26.24]	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD,
[03:26.63]	+ NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest]
[03:27.02]KING HENRY VI	My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
[03:30.14]	Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
[03:33.33]	Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
[03:36.77]	To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
[03:39.96]	Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
[03:43.08]	And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
[03:47.11]	On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.
[03:50.56]NORTHUMBERLAND	If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!
[03:53.42]CLIFFORD	The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
[03:56.86]WESTMORELAND	What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
[04:00.31]	My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
[04:03.49]KING HENRY VI	Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
[04:06.42]CLIFFORD	Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
[04:09.21]	He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
[04:12.53]	My gracious lord, here in the parliament
[04:15.52]	Let us assail the family of York.
[04:18.06]NORTHUMBERLAND	Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
[04:20.92]KING HENRY VI	Ah, know you not the city favours them,
[04:23.78]	And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
[04:27.22]EXETER	But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
[04:30.67]KING HENRY VI	Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
[04:34.05]	To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
[04:37.23]	Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
[04:40.36]	Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
[04:43.41]	Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
[04:46.73]	and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
[04:49.78]	I am thy sovereign.
[04:51.41]YORK	I am thine.
[04:52.51]EXETER	For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
[04:55.89]YORK	'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
[04:58.82]EXETER	Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
[05:01.68]WARWICK	Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
[05:04.60]	In following this usurping Henry.
[05:07.14]CLIFFORD	Whom should he follow but his natural king?
[05:10.33]WARWICK	True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
[05:13.71]KING HENRY VI	And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
[05:16.96]YORK	It must and shall be so: content thyself.
[05:19.95]WARWICK	Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
[05:22.74]WESTMORELAND	He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
[05:25.60]	And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
[05:29.18]WARWICK	And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
[05:32.23]	That we are those which chased you from the field
[05:35.88]	And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
[05:39.26]	March'd through the city to the palace gates.
[05:42.57]NORTHUMBERLAND	Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
[05:45.43]	And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
[05:48.94]WESTMORELAND	Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
[05:51.87]	Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
[05:55.44]	Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
[05:58.82]CLIFFORD	Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
[06:02.01]	I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
[06:04.81]	As shall revenge his death before I stir.
[06:07.86]WARWICK	Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
[06:11.37]YORK	Will you we show our title to the crown?
[06:14.36]	If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
[06:17.74]KING HENRY VI	What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
[06:20.86]	Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
[06:23.85]	Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
[06:27.17]	I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
[06:29.64]	Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
[06:32.96]	And seized upon their towns and provinces.
[06:36.08]WARWICK	Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
[06:39.46]KING HENRY VI	The lord protector lost it, and not I:
[06:42.25]	When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
[06:45.57]RICHARD	You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
[06:49.14]	Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
[06:52.52]EDWARD	Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
[06:55.45]MONTAGUE	Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
[06:58.89]	Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
[07:02.41]RICHARD	Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
[07:05.85]YORK	Sons, peace!
[07:06.96]KING HENRY VI	Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
[07:10.34]WARWICK	Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
[07:13.65]	And be you silent and attentive too,
[07:16.38]	For he that interrupts him shall not live.
[07:19.50]KING HENRY VI	Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
[07:23.08]	Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
[07:26.00]	No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
[07:29.13]	Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
[07:32.31]	And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
[07:35.76]	Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
[07:39.14]	My title's good, and better far than his.
[07:42.13]WARWICK	Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
[07:44.99]KING HENRY VI	Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
[07:48.17]YORK	'Twas by rebellion against his king.
[07:50.84]KING HENRY VI	[Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.--
[07:54.15]	Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?
[07:56.95]YORK	What then?
[07:57.99]KING HENRY VI	An if he may, then am I lawful king;
[08:00.66]	For Richard, in the view of many lords,
[08:03.52]	Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
[08:06.44]	Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
[08:09.30]YORK	He rose against him, being his sovereign,
[08:12.29]	And made him to resign his crown perforce.
[08:15.41]WARWICK	Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
[08:18.47]	Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
[08:21.52]EXETER	No; for he could not so resign his crown
[08:24.51]	But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
[08:28.03]KING HENRY VI	Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
[08:30.69]EXETER	His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
[08:33.75]YORK	Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
[08:36.74]EXETER	My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
[08:39.79]KING HENRY VI	[Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
[08:43.17]NORTHUMBERLAND	Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
[08:46.29]	Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
[08:49.35]WARWICK	Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
[08:52.21]NORTHUMBERLAND	Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
[08:55.53]	Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
[08:58.32]	Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
[09:01.64]	Can set the duke up in despite of me.
[09:04.43]CLIFFORD	King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
[09:07.36]	Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
[09:10.54]	May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
[09:13.66]	Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
[09:17.11]KING HENRY VI	O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
[09:20.16]YORK	Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
[09:22.90]	What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?
[09:26.08]WARWICK	Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
[09:29.14]	Or I will fill the house with armed men,
[09:32.13]	And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
[09:35.51]	Write up his title with usurping blood.
[09:38.43]	[He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
[09:38.82]	+ themselves]
[09:39.21]KING HENRY VI	My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
[09:42.20]	Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
[09:45.39]YORK	Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
[09:48.51]	And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.
[09:52.02]KING HENRY VI	I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
[09:54.56]	Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
[09:57.22]CLIFFORD	What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
[10:00.47]WARWICK	What good is this to England and himself!
[10:03.53]WESTMORELAND	Base, fearful and despairing Henry!
[10:06.13]CLIFFORD	How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
[10:09.25]WESTMORELAND	I cannot stay to hear these articles.
[10:12.04]NORTHUMBERLAND	Nor I.
[10:12.82]CLIFFORD	Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
[10:16.14]WESTMORELAND	Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
[10:19.33]	In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
[10:22.64]NORTHUMBERLAND	Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
[10:25.50]	And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
[10:28.43]CLIFFORD	In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
[10:31.35]	Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
[10:34.34]	[Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND]
[10:35.12]WARWICK	Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
[10:38.11]EXETER	They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
[10:41.56]KING HENRY VI	Ah, Exeter!
[10:42.60]WARWICK	Why should you sigh, my lord?
[10:44.81]KING HENRY VI	Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
[10:47.74]	Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
[10:50.47]	But be it as it may: I here entail
[10:53.07]	The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
[10:56.45]	Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
[10:59.57]	To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
[11:02.69]	To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
[11:05.61]	And neither by treason nor hostility
[11:08.41]	To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
[11:11.46]YORK	This oath I willingly take and will perform.
[11:14.71]WARWICK	Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
[11:18.03]KING HENRY VI	And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
[11:21.41]YORK	Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
[11:24.27]EXETER	Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
[11:27.52]	[Sennet. Here they come down]
[11:28.30]YORK	Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
[11:31.55]WARWICK	And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
[11:34.41]NORFOLK	And I to Norfolk with my followers.
[11:37.08]MONTAGUE	And I unto the sea from whence I came.
[11:39.94]	[Exeunt YORK, EDWARD, EDMUND, GEORGE, RICHARD,
[11:40.33]	+ WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, their Soldiers, and
[11:40.72]	+ Attendants]
[11:41.11]KING HENRY VI	And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
[11:44.17]	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD]
[11:44.95]EXETER	Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
[11:48.59]	I'll steal away.
[11:50.02]KING HENRY VI	Exeter, so will I.
[11:51.51]QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
[11:54.37]KING HENRY VI	Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
[11:57.36]QUEEN MARGARET	Who can be patient in such extremes?
[12:00.09]	Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
[12:03.08]	And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
[12:06.14]	Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
[12:09.52]	Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
[12:12.84]	Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
[12:16.02]	Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
[12:19.21]	Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
[12:22.20]	Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
[12:26.03]	Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
[12:29.35]	And disinherited thine only son.
[12:31.82]PRINCE EDWARD	Father, you cannot disinherit me:
[12:34.29]	If you be king, why should not I succeed?
[12:37.28]KING HENRY VI	Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
[12:40.21]	The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
[12:43.52]QUEEN MARGARET	Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
[12:46.97]	I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
[12:50.35]	Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
[12:53.34]	And given unto the house of York such head
[12:56.52]	As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
[12:59.77]	To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
[13:02.96]	What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
[13:05.75]	And creep into it far before thy time?
[13:08.62]	Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
[13:11.93]	Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
[13:15.18]	The duke is made protector of the realm;
[13:18.17]	And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
[13:21.49]	The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
[13:24.54]	Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
[13:27.53]	The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
[13:31.17]	Before I would have granted to that act.
[13:34.16]	But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
[13:37.74]	And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
[13:40.93]	Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
[13:43.79]	Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
[13:46.84]	Whereby my son is disinherited.
[13:49.25]	The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
[13:52.89]	Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
[13:56.27]	And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
[13:59.65]	And utter ruin of the house of York.
[14:02.38]	Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
[14:05.44]	Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.
[14:08.43]KING HENRY VI	Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
[14:11.35]QUEEN MARGARET	Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
[14:14.80]KING HENRY VI	Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
[14:17.85]QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
[14:20.39]PRINCE EDWARD	When I return with victory from the field
[14:23.51]	I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
[14:26.89]QUEEN MARGARET	Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
[14:29.68]	[Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD]
[14:30.46]KING HENRY VI	Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
[14:33.52]	Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
[14:36.71]	Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
[14:39.76]	Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
[14:42.75]	Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
[14:45.94]	Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
[14:48.80]	The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
[14:52.31]	I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
[14:55.49]	Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.
[14:58.42]EXETER	And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
[15:01.28]	[Exeunt]
