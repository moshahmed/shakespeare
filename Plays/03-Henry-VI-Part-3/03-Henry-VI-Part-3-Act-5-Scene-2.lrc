[00:00.62]	[A field of battle near Barnet.,]
[00:01.86]	[Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV, bringing
[00:02.48]	+ forth WARWICK wounded]
[00:03.10]KING EDWARD IV	So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
[00:08.28]	For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
[00:13.15]	Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
[00:17.71]	That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
[00:22.89]	[Exit]
[00:24.13]WARWICK	Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
[00:28.90]	And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
[00:33.87]	Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
[00:38.32]	My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
[00:44.02]	That I must yield my body to the earth
[00:48.68]	And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
[00:53.24]	Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
[00:58.00]	Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
[01:03.39]	Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
[01:08.26]	Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
[01:14.06]	And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
[01:19.65]	These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
[01:25.97]	Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
[01:30.84]	To search the secret treasons of the world:
[01:35.92]	The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
[01:41.41]	Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
[01:45.96]	For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
[01:51.25]	And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
[01:56.63]	Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
[02:01.60]	My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
[02:06.27]	Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
[02:11.03]	Is nothing left me but my body's length.
[02:15.80]	Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
[02:21.29]	And, live we how we can, yet die we must.
[02:25.95]	[Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET]
[02:27.19]SOMERSET	Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
[02:31.85]	We might recover all our loss again;
[02:36.20]	The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
[02:42.21]	Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!
[02:47.80]WARWICK	Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
[02:52.26]	If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
[02:57.44]	And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
[03:02.31]	Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
[03:07.59]	Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
[03:13.08]	That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
[03:18.36]	Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
[03:22.61]SOMERSET	Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
[03:27.68]	And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
[03:32.97]	And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
[03:37.94]	And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
[03:43.33]	Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
[03:48.09]	That mought not be distinguished; but at last
[03:53.37]	I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
[03:58.24]	'O, farewell, Warwick!'
[04:00.83]WARWICK	Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
[04:06.63]	For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
[04:12.64]	[Dies]
[04:13.88]OXFORD	Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
[04:18.86]	[Here they bear away his body. Exeunt]
