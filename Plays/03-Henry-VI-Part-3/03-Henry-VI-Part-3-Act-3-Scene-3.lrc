[00:00.38]	[France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.,]
[00:01.14]	[Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,
[00:01.52]	+ his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN
[00:01.91]	+ MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and
[00:02.29]	+ riseth up again]
[00:02.67]KING LEWIS XI	Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
[00:05.47]	Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
[00:08.47]	And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
[00:12.42]QUEEN MARGARET	No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
[00:15.22]	Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
[00:18.60]	Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
[00:21.59]	Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
[00:24.72]	But now mischance hath trod my title down,
[00:27.78]	And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
[00:30.77]	Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
[00:33.96]	And to my humble seat conform myself.
[00:36.70]KING LEWIS XI	Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
[00:40.39]QUEEN MARGARET	From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
[00:43.83]	And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
[00:47.53]KING LEWIS XI	Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
[00:50.59]	And sit thee by our side:
[00:52.56]	[Seats her by him]
[00:53.33]	Yield not thy neck
[00:54.92]	To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
[00:58.17]	Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
[01:01.16]	Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
[01:04.28]	It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
[01:07.53]QUEEN MARGARET	Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
[01:11.04]	And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
[01:14.42]	Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
[01:17.41]	That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
[01:20.15]	Is of a king become a banish'd man,
[01:22.76]	And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
[01:25.76]	While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
[01:28.82]	Usurps the regal title and the seat
[01:31.49]	Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
[01:34.36]	This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
[01:37.23]	With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
[01:40.41]	Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
[01:43.41]	And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
[01:46.40]	Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
[01:49.52]	Our people and our peers are both misled,
[01:52.52]	Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
[01:55.96]	And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
[01:59.14]KING LEWIS XI	Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
[02:02.33]	While we bethink a means to break it off.
[02:05.32]QUEEN MARGARET	The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
[02:08.51]KING LEWIS XI	The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
[02:11.57]QUEEN MARGARET	O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
[02:14.50]	And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
[02:17.75]	[Enter WARWICK]
[02:18.51]KING LEWIS XI	What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
[02:21.76]QUEEN MARGARET	Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
[02:25.01]KING LEWIS XI	Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
[02:28.52]	[He descends. She ariseth]
[02:29.28]QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
[02:32.02]	For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
[02:35.27]WARWICK	From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
[02:37.82]	My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
[02:40.94]	I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
[02:43.75]	First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
[02:46.80]	And then to crave a league of amity;
[02:49.48]	And lastly, to confirm that amity
[02:51.96]	With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
[02:55.34]	That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
[02:58.27]	To England's king in lawful marriage.
[03:01.01]QUEEN MARGARET	[Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
[03:04.33]WARWICK	[To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
[03:07.64]	I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
[03:10.70]	Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
[03:13.88]	To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
[03:17.07]	Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,
[03:20.32]	Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
[03:23.63]QUEEN MARGARET	King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
[03:26.50]	Before you answer Warwick. His demand
[03:29.24]	Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
[03:32.74]	But from deceit bred by necessity;
[03:35.29]	For how can tyrants safely govern home,
[03:38.16]	Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
[03:41.28]	To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
[03:44.47]	That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
[03:47.46]	Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
[03:50.84]	Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
[03:54.66]	Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
[03:57.72]	For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
[04:00.71]	Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
[04:04.22]WARWICK	Injurious Margaret!
[04:05.81]PRINCE EDWARD	And why not queen?
[04:07.34]WARWICK	Because thy father Henry did usurp;
[04:09.95]	And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
[04:13.27]OXFORD	Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
[04:16.39]	Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
[04:19.57]	And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
[04:22.57]	Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
[04:25.50]	And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
[04:28.62]	Who by his prowess conquered all France:
[04:31.55]	From these our Henry lineally descends.
[04:34.42]WARWICK	Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
[04:37.61]	You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
[04:40.73]	All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
[04:43.53]	Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
[04:47.23]	But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
[04:49.97]	Of threescore and two years; a silly time
[04:52.96]	To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
[04:56.08]OXFORD	Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
[04:59.46]	Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
[05:02.45]	And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
[05:05.39]WARWICK	Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
[05:08.38]	Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
[05:11.18]	For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
[05:14.31]OXFORD	Call him my king by whose injurious doom
[05:17.30]	My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
[05:20.10]	Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
[05:23.35]	Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
[05:26.48]	When nature brought him to the door of death?
[05:29.73]	No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
[05:32.78]	This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
[05:35.71]WARWICK	And I the house of York.
[05:37.63]KING LEWIS XI	Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
[05:40.56]	Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
[05:43.49]	While I use further conference with Warwick.
[05:46.67]	[They stand aloof]
[05:47.44]QUEEN MARGARET	Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
[05:51.07]KING LEWIS XI	Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
[05:54.32]	Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
[05:57.38]	To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
[06:00.63]WARWICK	Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
[06:03.62]KING LEWIS XI	But is he gracious in the people's eye?
[06:06.49]WARWICK	The more that Henry was unfortunate.
[06:09.17]KING LEWIS XI	Then further, all dissembling set aside,
[06:12.03]	Tell me for truth the measure of his love
[06:15.09]	Unto our sister Bona.
[06:16.81]WARWICK	Such it seems
[06:18.09]	As may beseem a monarch like himself.
[06:20.83]	Myself have often heard him say and swear
[06:23.88]	That this his love was an eternal plant,
[06:26.81]	Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
[06:30.13]	The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
[06:33.70]	Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
[06:36.50]	Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
[06:39.11]KING LEWIS XI	Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
[06:42.11]BONA	Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
[06:45.04]	[To WARWICK]
[06:45.80]	Yet I confess that often ere this day,
[06:48.61]	When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
[06:51.98]	Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
[06:54.98]KING LEWIS XI	Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
[06:58.35]	And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
[07:01.41]	Touching the jointure that your king must make,
[07:04.79]	Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
[07:07.98]	Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
[07:11.03]	That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
[07:14.22]PRINCE EDWARD	To Edward, but not to the English king.
[07:17.02]QUEEN MARGARET	Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
[07:19.70]	By this alliance to make void my suit:
[07:22.50]	Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
[07:25.62]KING LEWIS XI	And still is friend to him and Margaret:
[07:28.56]	But if your title to the crown be weak,
[07:31.42]	As may appear by Edward's good success,
[07:34.29]	Then 'tis but reason that I be released
[07:37.16]	From giving aid which late I promised.
[07:39.96]	Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
[07:43.08]	That your estate requires and mine can yield.
[07:46.33]WARWICK	Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
[07:49.26]	Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
[07:52.26]	And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
[07:55.32]	You have a father able to maintain you;
[07:58.18]	And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
[08:01.50]QUEEN MARGARET	Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
[08:04.62]	Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
[08:07.61]	I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
[08:10.86]	Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
[08:14.05]	Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
[08:17.30]	For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
[08:20.61]	[Post blows a horn within]
[08:21.38]KING LEWIS XI	Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
[08:24.31]	[Enter a Post]
[08:25.07]Post	[To WARWICK] My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
[08:28.70]	Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:
[08:31.70]	[To KING LEWIS XI]
[08:32.46]	These from our king unto your majesty:
[08:35.27]	[To QUEEN MARGARET]
[08:36.03]	And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.
[08:39.28]	[They all read their letters]
[08:40.04]OXFORD	I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
[08:43.49]	Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
[08:46.86]PRINCE EDWARD	Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
[08:50.11]	I hope all's for the best.
[08:52.15]KING LEWIS XI	Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
[08:55.53]QUEEN MARGARET	Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
[08:58.78]WARWICK	Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
[09:01.90]KING LEWIS XI	What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
[09:04.89]	And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
[09:07.76]	Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
[09:10.76]	Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
[09:14.13]	Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
[09:17.26]QUEEN MARGARET	I told your majesty as much before:
[09:19.87]	This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
[09:23.37]WARWICK	King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
[09:26.62]	And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
[09:29.62]	That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
[09:32.93]	No more my king, for he dishonours me,
[09:35.67]	But most himself, if he could see his shame.
[09:38.79]	Did I forget that by the house of York
[09:41.66]	My father came untimely to his death?
[09:44.40]	Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
[09:47.46]	Did I impale him with the regal crown?
[09:50.26]	Did I put Henry from his native right?
[09:53.06]	And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
[09:56.12]	Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
[09:59.12]	And to repair my honour lost for him,
[10:01.86]	I here renounce him and return to Henry.
[10:04.79]	My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
[10:07.65]	And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
[10:10.46]	I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
[10:13.26]	And replant Henry in his former state.
[10:16.06]QUEEN MARGARET	Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
[10:19.51]	And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
[10:22.56]	And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
[10:25.94]WARWICK	So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
[10:29.06]	That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
[10:32.19]	With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
[10:35.05]	I'll undertake to land them on our coast
[10:38.05]	And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
[10:41.11]	'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
[10:44.29]	And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
[10:47.35]	He's very likely now to fall from him,
[10:50.15]	For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
[10:53.47]	Or than for strength and safety of our country.
[10:56.84]BONA	Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
[10:59.77]	But by thy help to this distressed queen?
[11:02.77]QUEEN MARGARET	Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
[11:05.83]	Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
[11:08.82]BONA	My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
[11:12.01]WARWICK	And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
[11:15.00]KING LEWIS XI	And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
[11:18.19]	Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
[11:21.06]	You shall have aid.
[11:22.65]QUEEN MARGARET	Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
[11:25.71]KING LEWIS XI	Then, England's messenger, return in post,
[11:28.64]	And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
[11:31.57]	That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
[11:34.88]	To revel it with him and his new bride:
[11:37.75]	Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.
[11:41.13]BONA	Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
[11:44.50]	I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
[11:47.56]QUEEN MARGARET	Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
[11:50.62]	And I am ready to put armour on.
[11:53.04]WARWICK	Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
[11:56.23]	And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
[11:59.48]	There's thy reward: be gone.
[12:01.58]	[Exit Post]
[12:02.34]KING LEWIS XI	But, Warwick,
[12:03.49]	Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
[12:06.36]	Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
[12:09.86]	And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
[12:12.79]	And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
[12:15.98]	Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
[12:18.91]	What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
[12:21.84]WARWICK	This shall assure my constant loyalty,
[12:24.64]	That if our queen and this young prince agree,
[12:27.96]	I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
[12:31.02]	To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
[12:33.88]QUEEN MARGARET	Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
[12:36.94]	Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
[12:39.62]	Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
[12:42.87]	And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
[12:45.80]	That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.
[12:48.98]PRINCE EDWARD	Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
[12:52.04]	And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.
[12:55.04]	[He gives his hand to WARWICK]
[12:55.80]KING LEWIS XI	Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
[12:59.18]	And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
[13:02.05]	Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
[13:05.10]	I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
[13:08.23]	For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
[13:11.35]	[Exeunt all but WARWICK]
[13:12.11]WARWICK	I came from Edward as ambassador,
[13:14.60]	But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
[13:17.40]	Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
[13:20.65]	But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
[13:23.64]	Had he none else to make a stale but me?
[13:26.58]	Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
[13:29.89]	I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
[13:33.14]	And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
[13:36.20]	Not that I pity Henry's misery,
[13:38.55]	But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
[13:41.29]	[Exit]
