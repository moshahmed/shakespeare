[00:00.53]	[Coventry.,]
[00:01.60]	[Enter WARWICK, the Mayor of Coventry, two Messengers,
[00:02.14]	+ and others upon the walls]
[00:02.67]WARWICK	Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
[00:07.50]	How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?
[00:12.05]First Messenger	By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
[00:16.16]WARWICK	How far off is our brother Montague?
[00:19.91]	Where is the post that came from Montague?
[00:24.20]Second Messenger	By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
[00:28.40]	[Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE]
[00:29.47]WARWICK	Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
[00:33.49]	And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?
[00:37.78]SOMERSET	At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
[00:42.16]	And do expect him here some two hours hence.
[00:46.62]	[Drum heard]
[00:47.69]WARWICK	Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
[00:51.89]SOMERSET	It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
[00:56.00]	The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
[01:00.91]WARWICK	Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.
[01:05.65]SOMERSET	They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
[01:10.11]	[March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER,
[01:10.65]	+ and soldiers]
[01:11.19]KING EDWARD IV	Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
[01:15.47]GLOUCESTER	See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
[01:19.58]WARWICK	O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
[01:23.51]	Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
[01:28.25]	That we could hear no news of his repair?
[01:32.45]KING EDWARD IV	Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
[01:36.64]	Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
[01:41.11]	Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
[01:45.58]	And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
[01:49.69]WARWICK	Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
[01:54.06]	Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
[01:58.62]	Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
[02:02.37]	And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
[02:06.92]GLOUCESTER	I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
[02:11.66]	Or did he make the jest against his will?
[02:15.86]WARWICK	Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
[02:19.52]GLOUCESTER	Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
[02:23.54]	I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
[02:27.65]WARWICK	'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
[02:32.11]KING EDWARD IV	Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
[02:36.49]WARWICK	Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
[02:40.60]	And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
[02:44.89]	And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
[02:49.09]KING EDWARD IV	But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
[02:53.19]	And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
[02:57.21]	What is the body when the head is off?
[03:01.14]GLOUCESTER	Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
[03:05.16]	But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
[03:09.81]	The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
[03:14.10]	You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
[03:18.47]	And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.
[03:22.94]EDWARD	'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
[03:26.87]GLOUCESTER	Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
[03:31.78]	Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
[03:36.16]WARWICK	I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
[03:40.45]	And with the other fling it at thy face,
[03:44.56]	Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.
[03:48.84]KING EDWARD IV	Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
[03:53.85]	This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
[03:58.58]	Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
[04:03.22]	Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
[04:07.96]	'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
[04:12.51]	[Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours]
[04:13.59]WARWICK	O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
[04:17.87]OXFORD	Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
[04:20.91]	[He and his forces enter the city]
[04:21.98]GLOUCESTER	The gates are open, let us enter too.
[04:25.73]KING EDWARD IV	So other foes may set upon our backs.
[04:29.58]	Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
[04:33.77]	Will issue out again and bid us battle:
[04:37.79]	If not, the city being but of small defence,
[04:42.17]	We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
[04:46.73]WARWICK	O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
[04:50.66]	[Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours]
[04:51.73]MONTAGUE	Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
[04:55.12]	[He and his forces enter the city]
[04:56.19]GLOUCESTER	Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
[05:01.11]	Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
[05:05.66]KING EDWARD IV	The harder match'd, the greater victory:
[05:09.68]	My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
[05:13.97]	[Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours]
[05:15.04]SOMERSET	Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
[05:18.44]	[He and his forces enter the city]
[05:19.51]GLOUCESTER	Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
[05:23.53]	Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
[05:28.08]	And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
[05:32.82]	[Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours]
[05:33.89]WARWICK	And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
[05:38.44]	Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
[05:42.73]	With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
[05:47.20]	More than the nature of a brother's love!
[05:51.40]	Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.
[05:55.95]CLARENCE	Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
[06:00.33]	[Taking his red rose out of his hat]
[06:01.40]	Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
[06:05.15]	I will not ruinate my father's house,
[06:08.99]	Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
[06:13.73]	And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
[06:18.37]	That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
[06:22.93]	To bend the fatal instruments of war
[06:26.77]	Against his brother and his lawful king?
[06:30.88]	Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
[06:34.81]	To keep that oath were more impiety
[06:38.56]	Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
[06:43.38]	I am so sorry for my trespass made
[06:47.05]	That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
[06:51.42]	I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
[06:55.35]	With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
[06:59.46]	As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
[07:03.57]	To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
[07:07.86]	And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
[07:12.06]	And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
[07:16.34]	Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
[07:20.10]	And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
[07:24.20]	For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
[07:28.67]KING EDWARD IV	Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
[07:33.14]	Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
[07:37.51]GLOUCESTER	Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.
[07:41.80]WARWICK	O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
[07:45.73]KING EDWARD IV	What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
[07:50.56]	Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
[07:55.11]WARWICK	Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
[07:59.04]	I will away towards Barnet presently,
[08:02.88]	And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.
[08:07.17]KING EDWARD IV	Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
[08:11.55]	Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!
[08:16.01]	[Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick
[08:16.55]	+ and his company follow]
