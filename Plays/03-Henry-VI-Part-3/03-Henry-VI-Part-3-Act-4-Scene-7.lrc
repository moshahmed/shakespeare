[00:00.44]	[Before York.,]
[00:01.33]	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER,
[00:01.77]	+ HASTINGS, and Soldiers]
[00:02.21]KING EDWARD IV	Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
[00:06.13]	Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
[00:09.39]	And says that once more I shall interchange
[00:13.08]	My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
[00:16.41]	Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
[00:20.25]	And brought desired help from Burgundy:
[00:23.58]	What then remains, we being thus arrived
[00:26.98]	From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
[00:30.97]	But that we enter, as into our dukedom?
[00:34.23]GLOUCESTER	The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
[00:37.92]	For many men that stumble at the threshold
[00:41.55]	Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
[00:45.17]KING EDWARD IV	Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
[00:48.94]	By fair or foul means we must enter in,
[00:52.27]	For hither will our friends repair to us.
[00:55.74]HASTINGS	My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
[00:59.51]	[Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren]
[01:00.40]Mayor	My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
[01:04.02]	And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
[01:07.65]	For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
[01:10.83]KING EDWARD IV	But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
[01:14.15]	Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
[01:17.56]Mayor	True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
[01:21.03]KING EDWARD IV	Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
[01:24.65]	As being well content with that alone.
[01:27.91]GLOUCESTER	[Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
[01:31.97]	He'll soon find means to make the body follow.
[01:35.82]HASTINGS	Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
[01:39.37]	Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
[01:42.99]Mayor	Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.
[01:46.76]	[They descend]
[01:47.65]GLOUCESTER	A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
[01:51.05]HASTINGS	The good old man would fain that all were well,
[01:54.97]	So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
[01:58.59]	I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
[02:02.07]	Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
[02:05.61]	[Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below]
[02:06.50]KING EDWARD IV	So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
[02:10.27]	But in the night or in the time of war.
[02:13.60]	What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
[02:17.22]	[Takes his keys]
[02:18.11]	For Edward will defend the town and thee,
[02:21.58]	And all those friends that deign to follow me.
[02:25.43]	[March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers]
[02:26.32]GLOUCESTER	Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
[02:29.42]	Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.
[02:32.75]KING EDWARD IV	Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?
[02:36.30]MONTAGUE	To help King Edward in his time of storm,
[02:39.77]	As every loyal subject ought to do.
[02:42.80]KING EDWARD IV	Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
[02:46.28]	Our title to the crown and only claim
[02:49.53]	Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
[02:53.30]MONTAGUE	Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
[02:56.85]	I came to serve a king and not a duke.
[03:00.11]	Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
[03:03.51]	[The drum begins to march]
[03:04.39]KING EDWARD IV	Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
[03:07.94]	By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
[03:11.79]MONTAGUE	What talk you of debating? in few words,
[03:15.12]	If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
[03:18.96]	I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
[03:22.58]	To keep them back that come to succor you:
[03:26.13]	Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
[03:29.75]GLOUCESTER	Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
[03:33.67]KING EDWARD IV	When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
[03:37.67]	Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
[03:41.36]HASTINGS	Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
[03:45.06]GLOUCESTER	And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
[03:48.83]	Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:
[03:52.31]	The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
[03:56.15]KING EDWARD IV	Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
[03:59.55]	And Henry but usurps the diadem.
[04:02.36]MONTAGUE	Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
[04:05.91]	And now will I be Edward's champion.
[04:09.02]HASTINGS	Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
[04:12.86]	Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.
[04:16.48]	[Flourish]
[04:17.37]Soldier	Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
[04:21.21]	England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.
[04:24.69]MONTAGUE	And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
[04:28.31]	By this I challenge him to single fight.
[04:31.71]	[Throws down his gauntlet]
[04:32.60]All	Long live Edward the Fourth!
[04:35.12]KING EDWARD IV	Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
[04:39.11]	If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
[04:43.03]	Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;
[04:46.87]	And when the morning sun shall raise his car
[04:50.64]	Above the border of this horizon,
[04:53.53]	We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
[04:57.22]	For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
[05:00.62]	Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
[05:04.39]	To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
[05:07.87]	Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
[05:11.79]	Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
[05:15.48]	And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
[05:19.18]	[Exeunt]
