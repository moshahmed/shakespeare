[00:00.43]	[A forest in the north of England.,]
[00:01.29]	[Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands]
[00:02.15]First Keeper	Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
[00:06.32]	For through this laund anon the deer will come;
[00:10.14]	And in this covert will we make our stand,
[00:13.59]	Culling the principal of all the deer.
[00:16.75]Second Keeper	I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
[00:20.28]First Keeper	That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
[00:23.73]	Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
[00:27.32]	Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
[00:30.77]	And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
[00:34.08]	I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
[00:37.32]	In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
[00:41.06]Second Keeper	Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
[00:44.65]	[Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook]
[00:45.52]KING HENRY VI	From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
[00:49.11]	To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
[00:52.78]	No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
[00:55.80]	Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
[00:59.69]	Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
[01:03.64]	No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
[01:07.09]	No humble suitors press to speak for right,
[01:10.62]	No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
[01:13.85]	For how can I help them, and not myself?
[01:17.09]First Keeper	Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
[01:20.76]	This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.
[01:24.50]KING HENRY VI	Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
[01:27.44]	For wise men say it is the wisest course.
[01:30.82]Second Keeper	Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
[01:34.13]First Keeper	Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
[01:37.44]KING HENRY VI	My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
[01:41.04]	And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
[01:44.56]	Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
[01:48.59]	To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
[01:51.90]	Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
[01:55.42]	For Warwick is a subtle orator,
[01:58.08]	And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
[02:01.82]	By this account then Margaret may win him;
[02:05.27]	For she's a woman to be pitied much:
[02:08.29]	Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
[02:11.89]	Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
[02:15.34]	The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
[02:19.01]	And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
[02:22.17]	To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
[02:25.91]	Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
[02:29.29]	She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
[02:32.82]	He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
[02:36.20]	She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
[02:39.50]	He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
[02:43.03]	That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
[02:46.98]	Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
[02:50.94]	Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
[02:54.17]	And in conclusion wins the king from her,
[02:57.55]	With promise of his sister, and what else,
[03:00.93]	To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
[03:04.67]	O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
[03:08.27]	Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
[03:11.72]Second Keeper	Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
[03:15.82]KING HENRY VI	More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
[03:19.49]	A man at least, for less I should not be;
[03:22.80]	And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
[03:26.11]Second Keeper	Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
[03:29.63]KING HENRY VI	Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.
[03:32.79]Second Keeper	But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
[03:36.17]KING HENRY VI	My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
[03:39.41]	Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
[03:42.93]	Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
[03:46.39]	A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
[03:49.55]Second Keeper	Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
[03:53.07]	Your crown content and you must be contented
[03:56.74]	To go along with us; for as we think,
[03:59.76]	You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
[04:03.21]	And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
[04:06.81]	Will apprehend you as his enemy.
[04:09.54]KING HENRY VI	But did you never swear, and break an oath?
[04:12.99]Second Keeper	No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
[04:16.23]KING HENRY VI	Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
[04:20.04]Second Keeper	Here in this country, where we now remain.
[04:23.42]KING HENRY VI	I was anointed king at nine months old;
[04:26.66]	My father and my grandfather were kings,
[04:29.97]	And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
[04:33.35]	And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
[04:37.16]First Keeper	No;
[04:37.81]	For we were subjects but while you were king.
[04:41.47]KING HENRY VI	Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
[04:44.57]	Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
[04:48.02]	Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
[04:51.40]	And as the air blows it to me again,
[04:54.42]	Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
[04:57.44]	And yielding to another when it blows,
[05:00.60]	Commanded always by the greater gust;
[05:03.69]	Such is the lightness of you common men.
[05:07.00]	But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
[05:10.60]	My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
[05:14.12]	Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
[05:17.86]	And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
[05:21.10]First Keeper	We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
[05:24.77]KING HENRY VI	So would you be again to Henry,
[05:27.43]	If he were seated as King Edward is.
[05:30.45]First Keeper	We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
[05:33.97]	To go with us unto the officers.
[05:36.70]KING HENRY VI	In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
[05:40.44]	And what God will, that let your king perform;
[05:44.11]	And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
[05:47.20]	[Exeunt]
