[00:00.43]	[Another part of the field.,]
[00:01.30]	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph; with
[00:01.74]	+ GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest]
[00:02.18]KING EDWARD IV	Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
[00:05.81]	And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
[00:09.31]	But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
[00:12.94]	I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
[00:16.51]	That will encounter with our glorious sun,
[00:20.00]	Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
[00:23.20]	I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
[00:26.84]	Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
[00:30.55]	And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
[00:33.97]CLARENCE	A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
[00:37.60]	And blow it to the source from whence it came:
[00:41.39]	The very beams will dry those vapours up,
[00:44.80]	For every cloud engenders not a storm.
[00:48.01]GLOUCESTER	The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
[00:51.57]	And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:
[00:54.70]	If she have time to breathe be well assured
[00:58.33]	Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
[01:01.90]KING EDWARD IV	We are advertised by our loving friends
[01:05.25]	That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
[01:09.17]	We, having now the best at Barnet field,
[01:12.45]	Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
[01:16.30]	And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
[01:20.16]	In every county as we go along.
[01:22.85]	Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
[01:26.19]	[Exeunt]
