[00:00.51]	[Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.,]
[00:01.53]	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]
[00:02.55]CLEOPATRA	Give me some music; music, moody food
[00:06.14]	Of us that trade in love.
[00:08.78]Attendants	The music, ho!
[00:10.40]	[Enter MARDIAN]
[00:11.43]CLEOPATRA	Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.
[00:15.87]CHARMIAN	My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
[00:19.62]CLEOPATRA	As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
[00:23.37]	As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
[00:27.73]MARDIAN	As well as I can, madam.
[00:30.20]CLEOPATRA	And when good will is show'd, though't come
[00:34.38]	too short,
[00:35.75]	The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:
[00:39.76]	Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,
[00:44.02]	My music playing far off, I will betray
[00:47.86]	Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
[00:52.47]	Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
[00:56.31]	I'll think them every one an Antony,
[00:59.89]	And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'
[01:02.79]CHARMIAN	'Twas merry when
[01:04.67]	You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
[01:08.94]	Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
[01:13.03]	With fervency drew up.
[01:15.42]CLEOPATRA	That time,--O times!--
[01:17.47]	I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
[01:21.82]	I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
[01:25.92]	Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
[01:30.01]	Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
[01:34.28]	I wore his sword Philippan.
[01:37.09]	[Enter a Messenger]
[01:38.12]	O, from Italy
[01:39.74]	Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
[01:43.92]	That long time have been barren.
[01:47.16]Messenger	Madam, madam,--
[01:48.70]CLEOPATRA	Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,
[01:52.37]	Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
[01:56.63]	If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
[02:00.90]	My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
[02:04.99]	Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
[02:08.32]Messenger	First, madam, he is well.
[02:10.80]CLEOPATRA	Why, there's more gold.
[02:13.18]	But, sirrah, mark, we use
[02:15.66]	To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
[02:19.75]	The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
[02:23.85]	Down thy ill-uttering throat.
[02:26.84]Messenger	Good madam, hear me.
[02:28.97]CLEOPATRA	Well, go to, I will;
[02:31.02]	But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
[02:35.45]	Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour
[02:39.29]	To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
[02:43.30]	Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
[02:48.17]	Not like a formal man.
[02:50.56]Messenger	Will't please you hear me?
[02:53.29]CLEOPATRA	I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
[02:57.81]	Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
[03:01.48]	Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
[03:05.83]	I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
[03:10.01]	Rich pearls upon thee.
[03:12.40]Messenger	Madam, he's well.
[03:14.28]CLEOPATRA	Well said.
[03:15.64]Messenger	And friends with Caesar.
[03:18.20]CLEOPATRA	Thou'rt an honest man.
[03:20.59]Messenger	Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
[03:24.86]CLEOPATRA	Make thee a fortune from me.
[03:27.76]Messenger	But yet, madam,--
[03:29.46]CLEOPATRA	I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
[03:33.05]	The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
[03:36.72]	'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
[03:40.47]	Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
[03:44.48]	Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
[03:48.40]	The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
[03:53.27]	In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.
[03:58.22]Messenger	Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
[04:01.80]	He's bound unto Octavia.
[04:04.36]CLEOPATRA	For what good turn?
[04:06.49]Messenger	For the best turn i' the bed.
[04:09.39]CLEOPATRA	I am pale, Charmian.
[04:11.53]Messenger	Madam, he's married to Octavia.
[04:14.60]CLEOPATRA	The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
[04:18.61]	[Strikes him down]
[04:19.63]Messenger	Good madam, patience.
[04:21.85]CLEOPATRA	What say you? Hence,
[04:23.98]	[Strikes him again]
[04:25.01]	Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
[04:29.10]	Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
[04:33.20]	[She hales him up and down]
[04:34.22]	Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
[04:39.17]	Smarting in lingering pickle.
[04:42.16]Messenger	Gracious madam,
[04:43.95]	I that do bring the news made not the match.
[04:48.22]CLEOPATRA	Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
[04:52.40]	And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
[04:57.00]	Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
[05:01.19]	And I will boot thee with what gift beside
[05:05.37]	Thy modesty can beg.
[05:07.58]Messenger	He's married, madam.
[05:09.72]CLEOPATRA	Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
[05:12.87]	[Draws a knife]
[05:13.90]Messenger	Nay, then I'll run.
[05:15.95]	What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
[05:19.96]	[Exit]
[05:20.98]CHARMIAN	Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
[05:24.99]	The man is innocent.
[05:27.21]CLEOPATRA	Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
[05:31.22]	Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
[05:35.31]	Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
[05:39.41]	Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.
[05:43.42]CHARMIAN	He is afeard to come.
[05:45.72]CLEOPATRA	I will not hurt him.
[05:47.94]	[Exit CHARMIAN]
[05:48.97]	These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
[05:53.40]	A meaner than myself; since I myself
[05:56.99]	Have given myself the cause.
[05:59.89]	[Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger]
[06:00.91]	Come hither, sir.
[06:02.79]	Though it be honest, it is never good
[06:06.46]	To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
[06:10.81]	An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
[06:15.08]	Themselves when they be felt.
[06:18.06]Messenger	I have done my duty.
[06:20.28]CLEOPATRA	Is he married?
[06:21.99]	I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
[06:25.57]	If thou again say 'Yes.'
[06:27.96]Messenger	He's married, madam.
[06:30.09]CLEOPATRA	The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
[06:34.87]Messenger	Should I lie, madam?
[06:37.00]CLEOPATRA	O, I would thou didst,
[06:39.31]	So half my Egypt were submerged and made
[06:43.32]	A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:
[06:47.75]	Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
[06:51.59]	Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
[06:55.86]Messenger	I crave your highness' pardon.
[06:58.85]CLEOPATRA	He is married?
[07:00.55]Messenger	Take no offence that I would not offend you:
[07:04.82]	To punish me for what you make me do.
[07:08.49]	Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
[07:12.67]CLEOPATRA	O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
[07:17.02]	That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:
[07:21.71]	The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
[07:26.49]	Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
[07:31.01]	And be undone by 'em!
[07:33.23]	[Exit Messenger]
[07:34.26]CHARMIAN	Good your highness, patience.
[07:37.16]CLEOPATRA	In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
[07:41.42]CHARMIAN	Many times, madam.
[07:43.38]CLEOPATRA	I am paid for't now.
[07:45.60]	Lead me from hence:
[07:47.74]	I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.
[07:51.49]	Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
[07:55.16]	Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
[07:59.08]	Her inclination, let him not leave out
[08:02.84]	The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
[08:07.19]	[Exit ALEXAS]
[08:08.21]	Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,
[08:12.22]	Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
[08:16.40]	The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas
[08:20.16]	[To MARDIAN]
[08:21.18]	Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
[08:25.70]	But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.
[08:30.06]	[Exeunt]
