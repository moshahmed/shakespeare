[00:00.48]	[A plain in Syria.,]
[00:01.46]	[Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,
[00:01.95]	+ and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead
[00:02.44]	+ body of PACORUS borne before him]
[00:02.93]VENTIDIUS	Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
[00:07.02]	Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
[00:11.18]	Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
[00:15.26]	Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
[00:18.61]	Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
[00:21.47]SILIUS	Noble Ventidius,
[00:23.27]	Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
[00:27.76]	The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
[00:32.25]	Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
[00:35.76]	The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
[00:39.76]	Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
[00:43.68]	Put garlands on thy head.
[00:46.21]VENTIDIUS	O Silius, Silius,
[00:48.01]	I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
[00:52.01]	May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
[00:56.42]	Better to leave undone, than by our deed
[01:00.17]	Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
[01:04.67]	Caesar and Antony have ever won
[01:07.77]	More in their officer than person: Sossius,
[01:11.69]	One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
[01:15.44]	For quick accumulation of renown,
[01:18.63]	Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
[01:23.04]	Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
[01:27.28]	Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
[01:31.28]	The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
[01:35.78]	Than gain which darkens him.
[01:38.55]	I could do more to do Antonius good,
[01:41.98]	But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
[01:45.82]	Should my performance perish.
[01:48.68]SILIUS	Thou hast, Ventidius,
[01:50.80]	that
[01:51.70]	Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
[01:55.62]	Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!
[02:00.35]VENTIDIUS	I'll humbly signify what in his name,
[02:03.86]	That magical word of war, we have effected;
[02:07.78]	How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
[02:11.95]	The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
[02:15.54]	We have jaded out o' the field.
[02:18.48]SILIUS	Where is he now?
[02:20.28]VENTIDIUS	He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
[02:24.60]	The weight we must convey with's will permit,
[02:28.77]	We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!
[02:33.10]	[Exeunt]
