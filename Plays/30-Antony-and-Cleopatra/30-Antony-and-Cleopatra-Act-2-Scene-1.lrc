[00:00.40]	[Messina. POMPEY's house.,]
[00:01.20]	[Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in
[00:01.60]	+ warlike manner]
[00:02.00]POMPEY	If the great gods be just, they shall assist
[00:05.33]	The deeds of justest men.
[00:07.40]MENECRATES	Know, worthy Pompey,
[00:09.07]	That what they do delay, they not deny.
[00:12.00]POMPEY	Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
[00:15.41]	The thing we sue for.
[00:17.21]MENECRATES	We, ignorant of ourselves,
[00:19.28]	Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
[00:22.75]	Deny us for our good; so find we profit
[00:25.75]	By losing of our prayers.
[00:27.82]POMPEY	I shall do well:
[00:29.28]	The people love me, and the sea is mine;
[00:32.29]	My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
[00:35.62]	Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
[00:38.82]	In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
[00:41.76]	No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
[00:45.23]	He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
[00:48.17]	Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
[00:51.37]	Nor either cares for him.
[00:53.44]MENAS	Caesar and Lepidus
[00:55.10]	Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
[00:58.57]POMPEY	Where have you this? 'tis false.
[01:00.98]MENAS	From Silvius, sir.
[01:02.51]POMPEY	He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,
[01:05.78]	Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
[01:09.25]	Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
[01:12.05]	Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
[01:15.59]	Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
[01:18.79]	Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
[01:21.72]	Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;
[01:24.86]	That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
[01:28.40]	Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
[01:30.66]	[Enter VARRIUS]
[01:31.47]	How now, Varrius!
[01:32.93]VARRIUS	This is most certain that I shall deliver:
[01:36.14]	Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
[01:38.80]	Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
[01:41.74]	A space for further travel.
[01:43.94]POMPEY	I could have given less matter
[01:46.41]	A better ear. Menas, I did not think
[01:49.15]	This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
[01:52.88]	For such a petty war: his soldiership
[01:55.75]	Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
[01:58.89]	The higher our opinion, that our stirring
[02:02.02]	Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
[02:05.09]	The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
[02:07.49]MENAS	I cannot hope
[02:08.83]	Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
[02:12.16]	His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
[02:15.63]	His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
[02:19.03]	Not moved by Antony.
[02:20.77]POMPEY	I know not, Menas,
[02:22.30]	How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
[02:25.64]	Were't not that we stand up against them all,
[02:29.04]	'Twere pregnant they should square between
[02:32.25]	themselves;
[02:33.38]	For they have entertained cause enough
[02:36.38]	To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
[02:39.72]	May cement their divisions and bind up
[02:42.72]	The petty difference, we yet not know.
[02:45.59]	Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
[02:48.92]	Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
[02:52.13]	Come, Menas.
[02:53.26]	[Exeunt]
