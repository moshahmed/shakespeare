[00:00.39]	[Milan. The DUKE's palace.,]
[00:01.17]	[Enter VALENTINE and SPEED]
[00:01.95]SPEED	Sir, your glove.
[00:03.32]VALENTINE	Not mine; my gloves are on.
[00:05.41]SPEED	Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
[00:08.87]VALENTINE	Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
[00:11.74]	Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
[00:14.81]	Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
[00:16.31]SPEED	Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
[00:18.40]VALENTINE	How now, sirrah?
[00:19.77]SPEED	She is not within hearing, sir.
[00:22.12]VALENTINE	Why, sir, who bade you call her?
[00:24.47]SPEED	Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
[00:27.15]VALENTINE	Well, you'll still be too forward.
[00:29.69]SPEED	And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
[00:33.08]VALENTINE	Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
[00:36.28]SPEED	She that your worship loves?
[00:38.50]VALENTINE	Why, how know you that I am in love?
[00:41.18]SPEED	Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
[00:44.44]	learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
[00:47.84]	like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
[00:51.36]	robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
[00:54.88]	the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
[00:58.54]	lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
[01:02.26]	buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
[01:05.72]	diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
[01:09.05]	speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
[01:12.64]	wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
[01:16.36]	walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
[01:19.75]	fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
[01:23.14]	looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
[01:26.80]	are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
[01:30.52]	on you, I can hardly think you my master.
[01:33.52]VALENTINE	Are all these things perceived in me?
[01:36.33]SPEED	They are all perceived without ye.
[01:38.94]VALENTINE	Without me? they cannot.
[01:40.83]SPEED	Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
[01:44.29]	were so simple, none else would: but you are so
[01:47.68]	without these follies, that these follies are within
[01:51.47]	you and shine through you like the water in an
[01:54.93]	urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
[01:58.32]	physician to comment on your malady.
[02:01.06]VALENTINE	But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
[02:04.20]SPEED	She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
[02:07.59]VALENTINE	Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
[02:10.59]SPEED	Why, sir, I know her not.
[02:12.49]VALENTINE	Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
[02:15.94]	knowest her not?
[02:17.38]SPEED	Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
[02:19.66]VALENTINE	Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
[02:22.21]SPEED	Sir, I know that well enough.
[02:24.43]VALENTINE	What dost thou know?
[02:26.13]SPEED	That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
[02:29.65]VALENTINE	I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
[02:33.96]SPEED	That's because the one is painted and the other out
[02:37.74]	of all count.
[02:38.98]VALENTINE	How painted? and how out of count?
[02:41.53]SPEED	Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
[02:44.92]	man counts of her beauty.
[02:46.95]VALENTINE	How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
[02:50.34]SPEED	You never saw her since she was deformed.
[02:53.41]VALENTINE	How long hath she been deformed?
[02:55.89]SPEED	Ever since you loved her.
[02:57.91]VALENTINE	I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
[03:01.57]	see her beautiful.
[03:03.13]SPEED	If you love her, you cannot see her.
[03:05.81]VALENTINE	Why?
[03:06.46]SPEED	Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
[03:09.92]	or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
[03:13.57]	have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
[03:16.84]	ungartered!
[03:17.95]VALENTINE	What should I see then?
[03:19.84]SPEED	Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
[03:23.43]	for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
[03:27.02]	hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
[03:31.20]VALENTINE	Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
[03:34.26]	morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
[03:37.46]SPEED	True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
[03:40.92]	you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
[03:44.31]	bolder to chide you for yours.
[03:46.66]VALENTINE	In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
[03:49.54]SPEED	I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
[03:53.26]VALENTINE	Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
[03:56.91]	one she loves.
[03:58.22]SPEED	And have you?
[03:59.46]VALENTINE	I have.
[04:00.30]SPEED	Are they not lamely writ?
[04:02.33]VALENTINE	No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
[04:05.46]	here she comes.
[04:06.83]SPEED	[Aside] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
[04:10.09]	Now will he interpret to her.
[04:12.38]	[Enter SILVIA]
[04:13.16]VALENTINE	Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.
[04:16.36]SPEED	[Aside] O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.
[04:20.28]SILVIA	Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
[04:23.67]SPEED	[Aside] He should give her interest and she gives it him.
[04:27.65]VALENTINE	As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
[04:30.85]	Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
[04:33.92]	Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
[04:36.98]	But for my duty to your ladyship.
[04:39.53]SILVIA	I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
[04:43.12]VALENTINE	Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
[04:45.99]	For being ignorant to whom it goes
[04:48.67]	I writ at random, very doubtfully.
[04:51.21]SILVIA	Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
[04:54.61]VALENTINE	No, madam; so it stead you, I will write
[04:57.48]	Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--
[05:01.26]SILVIA	A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
[05:04.27]	And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
[05:07.66]	And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
[05:10.92]	Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
[05:14.06]SPEED	[Aside] And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'
[05:17.25]VALENTINE	What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
[05:20.52]SILVIA	Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
[05:23.58]	But since unwillingly, take them again.
[05:26.46]	Nay, take them.
[05:27.76]VALENTINE	Madam, they are for you.
[05:29.65]SILVIA	Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;
[05:32.53]	But I will none of them; they are for you;
[05:35.59]	I would have had them writ more movingly.
[05:38.66]VALENTINE	Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
[05:41.92]SILVIA	And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
[05:45.19]	And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
[05:48.06]VALENTINE	If it please me, madam, what then?
[05:50.54]SILVIA	Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:
[05:53.87]	And so, good morrow, servant.
[05:56.02]	[Exit]
[05:56.80]SPEED	O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
[05:59.55]	As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
[06:03.59]	My master sues to her, and she hath
[06:06.27]	taught her suitor,
[06:07.83]	He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
[06:10.77]	O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
[06:14.36]	That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
[06:18.15]	the letter?
[06:19.26]VALENTINE	How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?
[06:22.85]SPEED	Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
[06:26.31]VALENTINE	To do what?
[06:27.41]SPEED	To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
[06:30.09]VALENTINE	To whom?
[06:31.00]SPEED	To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.
[06:34.14]VALENTINE	What figure?
[06:35.31]SPEED	By a letter, I should say.
[06:37.34]VALENTINE	Why, she hath not writ to me?
[06:39.55]SPEED	What need she, when she hath made you write to
[06:42.95]	yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
[06:46.08]VALENTINE	No, believe me.
[06:47.39]SPEED	No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
[06:50.98]	her earnest?
[06:52.15]VALENTINE	She gave me none, except an angry word.
[06:55.02]SPEED	Why, she hath given you a letter.
[06:57.50]VALENTINE	That's the letter I writ to her friend.
[07:00.44]SPEED	And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
[07:04.22]VALENTINE	I would it were no worse.
[07:06.25]SPEED	I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
[07:08.53]	For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
[07:12.19]	Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
[07:15.97]	Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
[07:20.28]	Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
[07:24.65]	All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
[07:28.31]	Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.
[07:30.85]VALENTINE	I have dined.
[07:32.09]SPEED	Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can
[07:35.68]	feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my
[07:39.27]	victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like
[07:42.80]	your mistress; be moved, be moved.
[07:45.28]	[Exeunt]
