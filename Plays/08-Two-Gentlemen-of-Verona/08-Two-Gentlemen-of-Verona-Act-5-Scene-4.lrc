[00:00.55]	[Another part of the forest.,]
[00:01.67]	[Enter VALENTINE]
[00:02.79]VALENTINE	How use doth breed a habit in a man!
[00:06.70]	This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
[00:10.89]	I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
[00:15.73]	Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
[00:19.54]	And to the nightingale's complaining notes
[00:24.10]	Tune my distresses and record my woes.
[00:28.20]	O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
[00:32.30]	Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
[00:36.67]	Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
[00:40.86]	And leave no memory of what it was!
[00:44.68]	Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
[00:48.49]	Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
[00:53.15]	What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
[00:57.71]	These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
[01:03.01]	Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
[01:07.02]	They love me well; yet I have much to do
[01:11.30]	To keep them from uncivil outrages.
[01:15.11]	Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
[01:19.95]	[Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA]
[01:21.07]PROTEUS	Madam, this service I have done for you,
[01:25.26]	Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
[01:30.19]	To hazard life and rescue you from him
[01:34.38]	That would have forced your honour and your love;
[01:39.50]	Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
[01:44.06]	A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
[01:48.16]	And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
[01:52.91]VALENTINE	[Aside] How like a dream is this I see and hear!
[01:57.75]	Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
[02:02.03]SILVIA	O miserable, unhappy that I am!
[02:05.38]PROTEUS	Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
[02:09.10]	But by my coming I have made you happy.
[02:13.29]SILVIA	By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
[02:17.95]JULIA	[Aside] And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
[02:23.16]SILVIA	Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
[02:26.97]	I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
[02:31.54]	Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
[02:35.91]	O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
[02:40.10]	Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
[02:44.38]	And full as much, for more there cannot be,
[02:48.85]	I do detest false perjured Proteus.
[02:52.67]	Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
[02:56.67]PROTEUS	What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
[03:01.42]	Would I not undergo for one calm look!
[03:05.51]	O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
[03:10.07]	When women cannot love where they're beloved!
[03:14.82]SILVIA	When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
[03:19.47]	Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
[03:24.13]	For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
[03:29.43]	Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
[03:33.90]	Descended into perjury, to love me.
[03:37.63]	Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
[03:42.65]	And that's far worse than none; better have none
[03:47.68]	Than plural faith which is too much by one:
[03:52.24]	Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
[03:56.15]PROTEUS	In love
[03:57.45]	Who respects friend?
[03:59.87]SILVIA	All men but Proteus.
[04:02.29]PROTEUS	Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
[04:06.67]	Can no way change you to a milder form,
[04:10.86]	I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
[04:15.14]	And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
[04:20.17]SILVIA	O heaven!
[04:21.56]PROTEUS	I'll force thee yield to my desire.
[04:25.38]VALENTINE	Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
[04:29.57]	Thou friend of an ill fashion!
[04:32.92]PROTEUS	Valentine!
[04:34.41]VALENTINE	Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
[04:39.43]	For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
[04:43.81]	Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
[04:48.84]	Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
[04:53.40]	I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
[04:58.52]	Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
[05:03.54]	Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
[05:07.17]	I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
[05:11.45]	But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
[05:16.11]	The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
[05:21.23]	'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
[05:26.44]PROTEUS	My shame and guilt confounds me.
[05:29.98]	Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
[05:34.07]	Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
[05:37.89]	I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
[05:41.89]	As e'er I did commit.
[05:44.41]VALENTINE	Then I am paid;
[05:46.36]	And once again I do receive thee honest.
[05:50.64]	Who by repentance is not satisfied
[05:54.46]	Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
[05:59.58]	By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
[06:04.23]	And, that my love may appear plain and free,
[06:08.79]	All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
[06:13.08]JULIA	O me unhappy!
[06:14.84]	[Swoons]
[06:15.96]PROTEUS	Look to the boy.
[06:18.01]VALENTINE	Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
[06:22.48]	Look up; speak.
[06:24.34]JULIA	O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
[06:29.55]	to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
[06:35.23]PROTEUS	Where is that ring, boy?
[06:37.93]JULIA	Here 'tis; this is it.
[06:40.35]PROTEUS	How! let me see:
[06:42.30]	Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
[06:46.31]JULIA	O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
[06:50.12]	This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
[06:54.03]PROTEUS	But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
[06:58.87]	I gave this unto Julia.
[07:01.57]JULIA	And Julia herself did give it me;
[07:05.20]	And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
[07:09.58]PROTEUS	How! Julia!
[07:11.07]JULIA	Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
[07:15.54]	And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
[07:19.72]	How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
[07:24.56]	O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
[07:28.94]	Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
[07:33.31]	Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
[07:37.50]	In a disguise of love:
[07:40.11]	It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
[07:44.02]	Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
[07:49.23]PROTEUS	Than men their minds! 'tis true.
[07:52.58]	O heaven! were man
[07:54.82]	But constant, he were perfect. That one error
[07:59.47]	Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
[08:05.34]	Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
[08:09.25]	What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
[08:13.43]	More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
[08:17.90]VALENTINE	Come, come, a hand from either:
[08:21.16]	Let me be blest to make this happy close;
[08:25.53]	'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
[08:30.56]PROTEUS	Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.
[08:35.22]JULIA	And I mine.
[08:36.80]	[Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO]
[08:37.92]Outlaws	A prize, a prize, a prize!
[08:40.71]VALENTINE	Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.
[08:45.45]	Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
[08:49.83]	Banished Valentine.
[08:52.16]DUKE	Sir Valentine!
[08:54.02]THURIO	Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
[08:57.84]VALENTINE	Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
[09:02.40]	Come not within the measure of my wrath;
[09:06.68]	Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
[09:10.87]	Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
[09:15.43]	Take but possession of her with a touch:
[09:19.71]	I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
[09:23.99]THURIO	Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
[09:27.81]	I hold him but a fool that will endanger
[09:32.18]	His body for a girl that loves him not:
[09:36.37]	I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
[09:40.93]DUKE	The more degenerate and base art thou,
[09:45.03]	To make such means for her as thou hast done
[09:49.78]	And leave her on such slight conditions.
[09:54.06]	Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
[09:57.69]	I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
[10:01.41]	And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
[10:05.79]	Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
[10:10.25]	Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
[10:14.63]	Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
[10:19.10]	To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
[10:23.38]	Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
[10:27.48]	Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
[10:32.50]VALENTINE	I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
[10:37.44]	I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
[10:42.00]	To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
[10:46.46]DUKE	I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
[10:50.75]VALENTINE	These banish'd men that I have kept withal
[10:55.31]	Are men endued with worthy qualities:
[10:59.31]	Forgive them what they have committed here
[11:03.87]	And let them be recall'd from their exile:
[11:08.34]	They are reformed, civil, full of good
[11:12.34]	And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
[11:16.72]DUKE	Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:
[11:21.28]	Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
[11:26.12]	Come, let us go: we will include all jars
[11:30.40]	With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.
[11:34.59]VALENTINE	And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
[11:38.50]	With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
[11:43.43]	What think you of this page, my lord?
[11:47.34]DUKE	I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
[11:52.09]VALENTINE	I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
[11:56.56]DUKE	What mean you by that saying?
[11:59.81]VALENTINE	Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
[12:04.28]	That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
[12:08.56]	Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
[12:13.03]	The story of your loves discovered:
[12:16.85]	That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
[12:21.60]	One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
[12:25.97]	[Exeunt]
