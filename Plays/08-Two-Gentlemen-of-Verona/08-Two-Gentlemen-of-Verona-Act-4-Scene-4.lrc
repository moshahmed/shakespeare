[00:00.45]	[The same.,]
[00:01.35]	[Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog]
[00:02.26]LAUNCE	When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
[00:06.41]	look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
[00:10.56]	puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
[00:14.86]	four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
[00:19.09]	I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
[00:23.31]	'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
[00:27.31]	him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
[00:31.62]	and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
[00:35.99]	steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
[00:40.37]	O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
[00:44.60]	in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
[00:48.67]	one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
[00:52.82]	as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
[00:56.90]	more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
[01:01.35]	I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
[01:05.58]	live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
[01:09.50]	thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
[01:13.95]	gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
[01:18.10]	not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
[01:22.33]	all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
[01:26.41]	one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
[01:30.10]	out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
[01:33.95]	I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
[01:37.95]	knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
[01:42.03]	whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
[01:46.03]	the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
[01:49.65]	the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
[01:53.72]	wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
[01:57.80]	of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
[02:02.03]	his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
[02:06.10]	stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
[02:10.48]	been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
[02:14.86]	he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
[02:18.86]	Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
[02:23.01]	trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
[02:27.23]	Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
[02:31.61]	do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
[02:35.91]	water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
[02:39.99]	thou ever see me do such a trick?
[02:42.93]	[Enter PROTEUS and JULIA]
[02:43.84]PROTEUS	Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
[02:47.23]	And will employ thee in some service presently.
[02:51.23]JULIA	In what you please: I'll do what I can.
[02:54.55]PROTEUS	I hope thou wilt.
[02:56.29]	[To LAUNCE]
[02:57.19]	How now, you whoreson peasant!
[02:59.83]	Where have you been these two days loitering?
[03:03.68]LAUNCE	Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
[03:08.36]PROTEUS	And what says she to my little jewel?
[03:11.61]LAUNCE	Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
[03:15.68]	currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
[03:19.83]PROTEUS	But she received my dog?
[03:22.10]LAUNCE	No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
[03:26.02]	back again.
[03:27.30]PROTEUS	What, didst thou offer her this from me?
[03:30.70]LAUNCE	Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
[03:34.78]	the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
[03:38.85]	offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
[03:43.15]	yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
[03:46.70]PROTEUS	Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
[03:50.17]	Or ne'er return again into my sight.
[03:53.34]	Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?
[03:56.74]	[Exit LAUNCE]
[03:57.64]	A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
[04:01.42]	Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
[04:04.44]	Partly that I have need of such a youth
[04:07.91]	That can with some discretion do my business,
[04:11.76]	For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
[04:15.30]	But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
[04:18.92]	Which, if my augury deceive me not,
[04:21.94]	Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
[04:25.64]	Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
[04:29.57]	Go presently and take this ring with thee,
[04:33.19]	Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
[04:35.68]	She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
[04:38.92]JULIA	It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
[04:42.85]	She is dead, belike?
[04:44.73]PROTEUS	Not so; I think she lives.
[04:47.07]JULIA	Alas!
[04:47.90]PROTEUS	Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
[04:50.09]JULIA	I cannot choose
[04:51.75]	But pity her.
[04:53.19]PROTEUS	Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
[04:56.13]JULIA	Because methinks that she loved you as well
[04:59.90]	As you do love your lady Silvia:
[05:02.77]	She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
[05:06.47]	You dote on her that cares not for your love.
[05:10.32]	'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
[05:13.49]	And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
[05:16.73]PROTEUS	Well, give her that ring and therewithal
[05:20.20]	This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
[05:23.98]	I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
[05:27.83]	Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
[05:31.52]	Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
[05:35.15]	[Exit]
[05:36.05]JULIA	How many women would do such a message?
[05:39.45]	Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
[05:42.92]	A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
[05:46.24]	Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
[05:49.18]	That with his very heart despiseth me?
[05:52.50]	Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
[05:55.75]	Because I love him I must pity him.
[05:58.84]	This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
[06:02.62]	To bind him to remember my good will;
[06:05.86]	And now am I, unhappy messenger,
[06:08.66]	To plead for that which I would not obtain,
[06:12.35]	To carry that which I would have refused,
[06:15.90]	To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
[06:20.13]	I am my master's true-confirmed love;
[06:23.37]	But cannot be true servant to my master,
[06:26.84]	Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
[06:30.24]	Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
[06:33.79]	As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
[06:37.71]	[Enter SILVIA, attended]
[06:38.62]	Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
[06:42.31]	To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
[06:46.16]SILVIA	What would you with her, if that I be she?
[06:49.71]JULIA	If you be she, I do entreat your patience
[06:53.26]	To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
[06:56.88]SILVIA	From whom?
[06:58.09]JULIA	From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
[07:01.03]SILVIA	O, he sends you for a picture.
[07:03.67]JULIA	Ay, madam.
[07:04.80]SILVIA	Ursula, bring my picture here.
[07:07.44]	Go give your master this: tell him from me,
[07:11.07]	One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
[07:14.84]	Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
[07:18.76]JULIA	Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
[07:21.93]	Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
[07:24.88]	Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
[07:28.35]	This is the letter to your ladyship.
[07:31.52]SILVIA	I pray thee, let me look on that again.
[07:34.84]JULIA	It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
[07:37.93]SILVIA	There, hold!
[07:39.22]	I will not look upon your master's lines:
[07:42.76]	I know they are stuff'd with protestations
[07:46.46]	And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
[07:50.54]	As easily as I do tear his paper.
[07:53.48]JULIA	Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
[07:56.88]SILVIA	The more shame for him that he sends it me;
[08:00.57]	For I have heard him say a thousand times
[08:04.20]	His Julia gave it him at his departure.
[08:07.59]	Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
[08:11.59]	Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
[08:15.21]JULIA	She thanks you.
[08:16.80]SILVIA	What say'st thou?
[08:18.54]JULIA	I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
[08:21.86]	Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
[08:25.55]SILVIA	Dost thou know her?
[08:27.44]JULIA	Almost as well as I do know myself:
[08:30.53]	To think upon her woes I do protest
[08:33.70]	That I have wept a hundred several times.
[08:37.25]SILVIA	Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
[08:41.33]JULIA	I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
[08:45.40]SILVIA	Is she not passing fair?
[08:47.67]JULIA	She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
[08:51.06]	When she did think my master loved her well,
[08:54.84]	She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
[08:58.16]	But since she did neglect her looking-glass
[09:01.93]	And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
[09:05.25]	The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
[09:09.10]	And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
[09:12.72]	That now she is become as black as I.
[09:15.97]SILVIA	How tall was she?
[09:17.70]JULIA	About my stature; for at Pentecost,
[09:20.72]	When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
[09:24.57]	Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
[09:28.19]	And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
[09:31.66]	Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
[09:35.59]	As if the garment had been made for me:
[09:38.98]	Therefore I know she is about my height.
[09:42.46]	And at that time I made her weep agood,
[09:45.85]	For I did play a lamentable part:
[09:48.79]	Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
[09:51.51]	For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
[09:54.83]	Which I so lively acted with my tears
[09:58.15]	That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
[10:01.62]	Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
[10:05.10]	If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
[10:08.64]SILVIA	She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
[10:11.96]	Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
[10:14.91]	I weep myself to think upon thy words.
[10:18.23]	Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
[10:22.15]	For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
[10:26.53]	Farewell.
[10:27.66]	[Exit SILVIA, with attendants]
[10:28.57]JULIA	And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
[10:32.87]	A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
[10:36.49]	I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
[10:40.04]	Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
[10:43.81]	Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
[10:47.06]	Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
[10:50.45]	If I had such a tire, this face of mine
[10:53.85]	Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
[10:57.24]	And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
[11:00.94]	Unless I flatter with myself too much.
[11:04.26]	Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
[11:07.88]	If that be all the difference in his love,
[11:11.51]	I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
[11:14.68]	Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
[11:18.37]	Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
[11:22.22]	What should it be that he respects in her
[11:25.85]	But I can make respective in myself,
[11:29.02]	If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
[11:32.56]	Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
[11:36.11]	For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
[11:39.58]	Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
[11:43.73]	And, were there sense in his idolatry,
[11:46.98]	My substance should be statue in thy stead.
[11:50.68]	I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
[11:54.37]	That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
[11:57.69]	I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
[12:01.69]	To make my master out of love with thee!
[12:05.16]	[Exit]
