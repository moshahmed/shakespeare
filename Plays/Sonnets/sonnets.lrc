@@ THE SONNETS, by William Shakespeare
@ Sonnet 1
[00:01.76]From fairest creatures we desire increase,
[00:06.05]That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
[00:11.11]But as the riper should by time decease,
[00:14.56]His tender heir might bear his memory:
[00:19.49]But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
[00:23.52]Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
[00:26.53]Making a famine where abundance lies,
[00:29.53]Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
[00:36.26]Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
[00:41.18]And only herald to the gaudy spring,
[00:43.23]Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
[00:47.20]And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
[00:53.86]Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
[00:58.98]To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
@ Sonnet 2
[01:06.14]When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
[01:09.65] And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
[01:13.30] Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
[01:17.40] Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:
[01:21.88] Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
[01:25.15] Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
[01:28.22] To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
[01:31.80] Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
[01:36.02] How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
[01:39.54] If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
[01:43.96] Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
[01:48.19] Proving his beauty by succession thine.
[01:53.17] This were to be new made when thou art old,
[01:57.28] And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
@ Sonnet 3
[02:04.18] Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
[02:08.79] Now is the time that face should form another,
[02:11.86] Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
[02:15.71] Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
[02:20.57] For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
[02:24.09] Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
[02:27.01] Die single and thine image dies with thee.
[02:27.67] Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
[02:31.45] Of his self-love to stop posterity?
[02:34.84] Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
[02:39.64] Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
[02:41.17] So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
[02:45.33] Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
[02:49.11] But if thou live remembered not to be,
@ Sonnet 4
[03:02.16] Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,
[03:06.78] Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
[03:09.02] Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
[03:13.37] And being frank she lends to those are free:
[03:17.59] Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,
[03:21.05] The bounteous largess given thee to give?
[03:24.69] Profitless usurer why dost thou use
[03:27.83] So great a sum of sums yet canst not live?
[03:30.84] For having traffic with thy self alone,
[03:35.26] Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,
[03:39.28] Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
[03:43.96] What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
[03:46.83] Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
[03:52.92] Which used lives th' executor to be.
@ Sonnet 5
[03:59.12] Those hours that with gentle work did frame
[04:02.91] The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
[04:06.87] Will play the tyrants to the very same,
[04:10.58] And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
[04:14.29] For never-resting time leads summer on
[04:18.52] To hideous winter and confounds him there,
[04:22.61] Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
[04:28.06] Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
[04:30.51] Lo in the orient when the gracious light
[04:33.43] Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
[04:34.71] Then were not summer's distillation left
[04:36.34] Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
[04:38.74] A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
[04:38.89] Serving with looks his sacred majesty,
[04:41.08] And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
[04:42.20] Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
[04:43.99] Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
[04:45.98] Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
[04:46.54] Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
[04:49.09] Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
[04:49.56] But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,
[04:50.91] But when from highmost pitch with weary car,
[04:53.46] Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.
@ Sonnet 6
[04:53.83] Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
[04:56.74] The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
[04:59.29] From his low tract and look another way:
[05:02.21] So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:
[05:03.38] Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,
[05:05.48] Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
[05:08.40] Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
[05:09.53] In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
[05:11.68] Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
[05:13.75] Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,
[05:14.96] Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
[05:16.50] With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:
[05:18.96] Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
[05:19.46] That use is not forbidden usury,
[05:21.88] If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
[05:22.59] Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
[05:24.79] By unions married do offend thine ear,
[05:26.23] That's for thy self to breed another thee,
[05:27.34] They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
[05:28.92] Or ten times happier be it ten for one,
[05:30.26] In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:
[05:30.77] Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
[05:33.17] Mark how one string sweet husband to another,
[05:36.03] If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
[05:36.09] Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
[05:38.64] Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
[05:41.19] Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
[05:42.04] Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
[05:44.46] Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
[05:44.53] Leaving thee living in posterity?
[05:47.01] Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.
[05:48.38] Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,
[05:50.29] Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
[05:53.75] To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
@ Sonnet 7
@ Sonnet 8
@ Sonnet 9
[05:53.94] That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
[05:57.21] Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
[06:00.13] The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,
[06:03.41] The world will be thy widow and still weep,
[06:06.69] That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
[06:09.97] When every private widow well may keep,
[06:12.52] By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
[06:16.16] Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
[06:19.44] Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
[06:23.08] But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
[06:26.72] And kept unused the user so destroys it:
[06:29.64] No love toward others in that bosom sits
[06:32.55] That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
@ Sonnet 10
[06:35.47] For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
[06:39.11] Who for thy self art so unprovident.
[06:41.66] Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
[06:44.94] But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
[06:48.22] For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,
[06:51.50] That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
[06:55.14] Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
[06:57.32] Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
[07:00.24] O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,
[07:03.88] Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
[07:06.80] Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,
[07:09.71] Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,
[07:12.99] Make thee another self for love of me,
[07:15.90] That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
@ Sonnet 11
[07:19.18] As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,
[07:23.19] In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
[07:26.47] And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
[07:29.75] Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,
[07:33.03] Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
[07:35.21] Without this folly, age, and cold decay,
[07:37.76] If all were minded so, the times should cease,
[07:41.04] And threescore year would make the world away:
[07:43.95] Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
[07:47.23] Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
[07:49.42] Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;
[07:52.70] Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
[07:55.61] She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
[07:58.89] Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
@ Sonnet 12
[08:02.17] When I do count the clock that tells the time,
[08:05.81] And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
[08:09.09] When I behold the violet past prime,
[08:11.64] And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:
[08:14.92] When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
[08:17.83] Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
[08:20.75] And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
[08:24.03] Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:
[08:27.31] Then of thy beauty do I question make
[08:30.22] That thou among the wastes of time must go,
[08:33.50] Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
[08:36.05] And die as fast as they see others grow,
[08:39.33] And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
[08:42.61] Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.
@ Sonnet 13
[08:46.25] O that you were your self, but love you are
[08:49.89] No longer yours, than you your self here live,
[08:53.17] Against this coming end you should prepare,
[08:55.72] And your sweet semblance to some other give.
[08:58.64] So should that beauty which you hold in lease
[09:01.91] Find no determination, then you were
[09:04.10] Your self again after your self's decease,
[09:07.01] When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
[09:10.29] Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
[09:13.57] Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
[09:15.76] Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
[09:18.67] And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
[09:21.59] O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,
[09:24.86] You had a father, let your son say so.
@ Sonnet 14
[09:28.14] Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,
[09:31.42] And yet methinks I have astronomy,
[09:33.61] But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
[09:36.89] Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,
[09:39.44] Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
[09:42.35] Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
[09:45.27] Or say with princes if it shall go well
[09:48.54] By oft predict that I in heaven find.
[09:51.46] But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
[09:54.37] And constant stars in them I read such art
[09:57.65] As truth and beauty shall together thrive
[10:00.20] If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:
[10:03.48] Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
[10:06.03] Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
@ Sonnet 15
[10:10.04] When I consider every thing that grows
[10:12.59] Holds in perfection but a little moment.
[10:15.14] That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
[10:18.05] Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.
[10:20.60] When I perceive that men as plants increase,
[10:23.52] Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:
[10:26.80] Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
[10:29.71] And wear their brave state out of memory.
[10:32.62] Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,
[10:35.17] Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
[10:38.45] Where wasteful time debateth with decay
[10:40.64] To change your day of youth to sullied night,
[10:43.92] And all in war with Time for love of you,
[10:47.56] As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
@ Sonnet 16
[10:50.84] But wherefore do not you a mightier way
[10:53.75] Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?
[10:56.30] And fortify your self in your decay
[10:58.85] With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
[11:01.77] Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
[11:05.05] And many maiden gardens yet unset,
[11:07.23] With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
[11:10.15] Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
[11:12.33] So should the lines of life that life repair
[11:15.61] Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen
[11:18.89] Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
[11:21.44] Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
[11:25.08] To give away your self, keeps your self still,
[11:28.36] And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
@ Sonnet 17
[11:32.01] Who will believe my verse in time to come
[11:35.28] If it were filled with your most high deserts?
[11:38.56] Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
[11:42.21] Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:
[11:45.85] If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
[11:49.13] And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
[11:52.04] The age to come would say this poet lies,
[11:55.32] Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.
[11:58.23] So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
[12:01.15] Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
[12:04.79] And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
[12:08.44] And stretched metre of an antique song.
[12:10.99] But were some child of yours alive that time,
[12:14.26] You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.
@ Sonnet 18
[12:17.91] Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
[12:21.19] Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
[12:23.74] Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
[12:27.01] And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
[12:30.66] Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
[12:33.57] And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
[12:36.12] And every fair from fair sometime declines,
[12:38.67] By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:
[12:41.59] But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
[12:44.14] Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
[12:47.42] Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
[12:51.06] When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
[12:54.34] So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
[12:57.98] So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
@ Sonnet 19
[13:01.62] Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,
[13:04.54] And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
[13:07.82] Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
[13:11.46] And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
[13:14.74] Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,
[13:18.02] And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
[13:21.29] To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
[13:24.57] But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,
[13:27.49] O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
[13:31.50] Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,
[13:34.77] Him in thy course untainted do allow,
[13:37.32] For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
[13:39.87] Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
[13:43.15] My love shall in my verse ever live young.
@ Sonnet 20
[13:46.43] A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
[13:50.07] Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,
[13:52.99] A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
[13:55.90] With shifting change as is false women's fashion,
[13:59.18] An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
[14:02.82] Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,
[14:05.01] A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
[14:08.29] Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
[14:11.93] And for a woman wert thou first created,
[14:14.85] Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
[14:18.13] And by addition me of thee defeated,
[14:20.68] By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
[14:23.59] But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
[14:27.23] Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
@ Sonnet 21
[14:31.24] So is it not with me as with that muse,
[14:34.88] Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
[14:37.80] Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
[14:40.71] And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
[14:43.63] Making a couplement of proud compare
[14:45.81] With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
[14:49.82] With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
[14:53.46] That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
[14:56.74] O let me true in love but truly write,
[15:00.02] And then believe me, my love is as fair,
[15:03.30] As any mother's child, though not so bright
[15:06.58] As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
[15:09.86] Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
[15:13.13] I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
@ Sonnet 22
[15:16.41] My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
[15:19.69] So long as youth and thou are of one date,
[15:23.33] But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
[15:26.61] Then look I death my days should expiate.
[15:29.53] For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
[15:32.44] Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
[15:35.36] Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,
[15:38.10] How can I then be elder than thou art?
[15:42.28] O therefore love be of thyself so wary,
[15:45.19] As I not for my self, but for thee will,
[15:48.84] Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
[15:52.11] As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
[15:55.03] Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
[15:58.31] Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.
@ Sonnet 23
[16:01.95] As an unperfect actor on the stage,
[16:04.50] Who with his fear is put beside his part,
[16:07.78] Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
[16:11.06] Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
[16:13.97] So I for fear of trust, forget to say,
[16:17.25] The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
[16:19.80] And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
[16:23.44] O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:
[16:27.09] O let my looks be then the eloquence,
[16:30.00] And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
[16:32.55] Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
[16:35.47] More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
[16:38.74] O learn to read what silent love hath writ,
[16:42.02] To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
@ Sonnet 24
[16:45.67] Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
[16:48.95] Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,
[16:52.22] My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
[16:55.14] And perspective it is best painter's art.
[16:58.05] For through the painter must you see his skill,
[17:01.33] To find where your true image pictured lies,
[17:04.25] Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
[17:07.52] That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:
[17:10.44] Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,
[17:14.08] Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
[17:17.72] Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
[17:21.00] Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
[17:23.92] Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
[17:27.20] They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
@ Sonnet 25
[17:30.84] Let those who are in favour with their stars,
[17:34.12] Of public honour and proud titles boast,
[17:36.67] Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
[17:39.58] Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
[17:42.50] Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,
[17:45.05] But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
[17:48.33] And in themselves their pride lies buried,
[17:50.88] For at a frown they in their glory die.
[17:54.15] The painful warrior famoused for fight,
[17:56.34] After a thousand victories once foiled,
[17:58.53] Is from the book of honour razed quite,
[18:01.44] And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
[18:04.72] Then happy I that love and am beloved
[18:07.63] Where I may not remove nor be removed.
@ Sonnet 26
[18:10.55] Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
[18:13.46] Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
[18:16.01] To thee I send this written embassage
[18:18.56] To witness duty, not to show my wit.
[18:21.48] Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
[18:24.76] May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;
[18:28.40] But that I hope some good conceit of thine
[18:31.68] In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:
[18:35.32] Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
[18:37.87] Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
[18:40.42] And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
[18:42.97] To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,
[18:45.88] Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
[18:49.89] Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
@ Sonnet 27
[18:53.90] Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
[18:57.18] The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,
[19:00.09] But then begins a journey in my head
[19:03.01] To work my mind, when body's work's expired.
[19:06.65] For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
[19:09.93] Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
[19:12.11] And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
[19:14.66] Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
[19:17.58] Save that my soul's imaginary sight
[19:20.13] Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
[19:22.68] Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
[19:25.59] Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
[19:28.87] Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
[19:32.52] For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.
@ Sonnet 28
[19:35.79] How can I then return in happy plight
[19:38.71] That am debarred the benefit of rest?
[19:41.26] When day's oppression is not eased by night,
[19:44.54] But day by night and night by day oppressed.
[19:47.82] And each (though enemies to either's reign)
[19:50.73] Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
[19:53.64] The one by toil, the other to complain
[19:56.56] How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
[19:59.84] I tell the day to please him thou art bright,
[20:03.48] And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
[20:07.12] So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,
[20:09.67] When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
[20:13.32] But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
[20:16.23] And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
@ Sonnet 29
[20:19.87] When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,
[20:23.15] I all alone beweep my outcast state,
[20:25.70] And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
[20:28.62] And look upon my self and curse my fate,
[20:31.90] Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
[20:35.17] Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
[20:38.09] Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
[20:41.73] With what I most enjoy contented least,
[20:44.28] Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
[20:47.20] Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
[20:50.48] (Like to the lark at break of day arising
[20:54.12] From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,
[20:57.40] For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
[21:00.31] That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
@ Sonnet 30
[21:03.95] When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
[21:06.87] I summon up remembrance of things past,
[21:09.42] I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
[21:13.06] And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
[21:17.07] Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
[21:20.35] For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
[21:23.63] And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
[21:26.91] And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
[21:30.18] Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
[21:32.73] And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
[21:36.01] The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
[21:38.56] Which I new pay as if not paid before.
[21:41.84] But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)
[21:45.48] All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
@ Sonnet 31
[21:48.03] Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
[21:50.58] Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
[21:53.13] And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
[21:56.78] And all those friends which I thought buried.
[21:59.69] How many a holy and obsequious tear
[22:02.24] Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
[22:05.52] As interest of the dead, which now appear,
[22:08.44] But things removed that hidden in thee lie.
[22:11.35] Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
[22:14.63] Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
[22:17.54] Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
[22:21.19] That due of many, now is thine alone.
[22:24.10] Their images I loved, I view in thee,
[22:27.01] And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.
@ Sonnet 32
[22:30.66] If thou survive my well-contented day,
[22:33.21] When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
[22:36.85] And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
[22:39.76] These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:
[22:42.68] Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
[22:45.96] And though they be outstripped by every pen,
[22:48.87] Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
[22:52.15] Exceeded by the height of happier men.
[22:54.70] O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,
[22:57.62] 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
[23:01.62] A dearer birth than this his love had brought
[23:04.90] To march in ranks of better equipage:
[23:07.45] But since he died and poets better prove,
[23:10.37] Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.
@ Sonnet 33
[23:14.37] Full many a glorious morning have I seen,
[23:17.29] Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
[23:19.84] Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
[23:22.39] Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:
[23:24.57] Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
[23:27.12] With ugly rack on his celestial face,
[23:29.67] And from the forlorn world his visage hide
[23:32.59] Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
[23:35.14] Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
[23:38.42] With all triumphant splendour on my brow,
[23:40.97] But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
[23:44.25] The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
[23:47.52] Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
[23:50.80] Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.
@ Sonnet 34
[23:54.81] Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
[23:57.72] And make me travel forth without my cloak,
[24:00.64] To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
[24:04.28] Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?
[24:07.20] 'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
[24:10.84] To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
[24:14.12] For no man well of such a salve can speak,
[24:17.76] That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
[24:21.04] Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,
[24:24.32] Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,
[24:27.60] Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
[24:30.51] To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
[24:33.79] Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
[24:37.43] And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
@ Sonnet 35
[24:40.71] No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,
[24:44.35] Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
[24:46.91] Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
[24:49.82] And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
[24:52.37] All men make faults, and even I in this,
[24:55.65] Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
[24:57.47] My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
[24:59.66] Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
[25:02.57] For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,
[25:05.85] Thy adverse party is thy advocate,
[25:08.03] And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
[25:10.95] Such civil war is in my love and hate,
[25:14.23] That I an accessary needs must be,
[25:16.78] To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
@ Sonnet 36
[25:20.06] Let me confess that we two must be twain,
[25:23.33] Although our undivided loves are one:
[25:25.52] So shall those blots that do with me remain,
[25:28.80] Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
[25:31.71] In our two loves there is but one respect,
[25:34.99] Though in our lives a separable spite,
[25:37.54] Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
[25:40.82] Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
[25:44.46] I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
[25:46.65] Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
[25:49.56] Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
[25:52.11] Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
[25:55.03] But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
[25:58.67] As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
@ Sonnet 37
[26:01.95] As a decrepit father takes delight,
[26:04.14] To see his active child do deeds of youth,
[26:07.42] So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite
[26:10.69] Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
[26:13.97] For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
[26:16.89] Or any of these all, or all, or more
[26:20.17] Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
[26:22.72] I make my love engrafted to this store:
[26:25.63] So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
[26:28.91] Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,
[26:31.82] That I in thy abundance am sufficed,
[26:34.37] And by a part of all thy glory live:
[26:37.65] Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,
[26:41.29] This wish I have, then ten times happy me.
@ Sonnet 38
[26:44.57] How can my muse want subject to invent
[26:47.49] While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,
[26:51.13] Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,
[26:53.32] For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
[26:55.50] O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,
[26:59.15] Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,
[27:01.33] For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
[27:04.97] When thou thy self dost give invention light?
[27:07.89] Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
[27:11.53] Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,
[27:14.08] And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
[27:17.72] Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
[27:19.91] If my slight muse do please these curious days,
[27:23.19] The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
@ Sonnet 39
[27:26.83] O how thy worth with manners may I sing,
[27:30.11] When thou art all the better part of me?
[27:33.39] What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
[27:37.03] And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
[27:41.04] Even for this, let us divided live,
[27:43.59] And our dear love lose name of single one,
[27:46.87] That by this separation I may give:
[27:49.42] That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:
[27:52.70] O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,
[27:55.61] Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
[27:58.89] To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
[28:01.80] Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.
[28:04.72] And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
[28:07.10] By praising him here who doth hence remain.
@ Sonnet 40
[28:10.91] Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
[28:14.56] What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
[28:17.83] No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
[28:21.48] All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
[28:24.76] Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
[28:28.03] I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,
[28:31.31] But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest
[28:34.59] By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.
[28:37.51] I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
[28:40.06] Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
[28:42.61] And yet love knows it is a greater grief
[28:45.88] To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.
[28:49.16] Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
[28:52.08] Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
@ Sonnet 41
[28:55.72] Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
[28:57.91] When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
[29:00.82] Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
[29:03.74] For still temptation follows where thou art.
[29:06.29] Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
[29:09.20] Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.
[29:11.75] And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
[29:15.03] Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
[29:17.94] Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
[29:21.22] And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
[29:24.14] Who lead thee in their riot even there
[29:27.05] Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
[29:30.33] Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
[29:33.24] Thine by thy beauty being false to me.
@ Sonnet 42
[29:36.16] That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
[29:39.80] And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
[29:43.44] That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
[29:46.72] A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
[29:50.00] Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,
[29:52.55] Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,
[29:56.56] And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
[30:00.20] Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
[30:03.84] If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
[30:07.85] And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
[30:11.13] Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
[30:14.41] And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
[30:18.05] But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,
[30:22.06] Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.
@ Sonnet 43
[30:24.97] When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,
[30:28.62] For all the day they view things unrespected,
[30:31.53] But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
[30:35.17] And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
[30:38.09] Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
[30:41.00] How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,
[30:44.28] To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
[30:47.56] When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
[30:50.48] How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,
[30:53.75] By looking on thee in the living day,
[30:56.67] When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,
[30:59.58] Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
[31:02.50] All days are nights to see till I see thee,
[31:06.14] And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
@ Sonnet 44
[31:09.78] If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
[31:13.06] Injurious distance should not stop my way,
[31:15.61] For then despite of space I would be brought,
[31:18.89] From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,
[31:21.80] No matter then although my foot did stand
[31:24.72] Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,
[31:27.27] For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
[31:30.55] As soon as think the place where he would be.
[31:34.19] But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought
[31:37.83] To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
[31:41.48] But that so much of earth and water wrought,
[31:44.76] I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.
[31:48.03] Receiving nought by elements so slow,
[31:50.22] But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
@ Sonnet 45
[31:53.13] The other two, slight air, and purging fire,
[31:56.05] Are both with thee, wherever I abide,
[31:58.60] The first my thought, the other my desire,
[32:01.51] These present-absent with swift motion slide.
[32:04.06] For when these quicker elements are gone
[32:06.61] In tender embassy of love to thee,
[32:09.16] My life being made of four, with two alone,
[32:12.44] Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.
[32:14.99] Until life's composition be recured,
[32:17.18] By those swift messengers returned from thee,
[32:19.73] Who even but now come back again assured,
[32:22.64] Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
[32:25.56] This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,
[32:28.84] I send them back again and straight grow sad.
@ Sonnet 46
[32:32.11] Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
[32:35.39] How to divide the conquest of thy sight,
[32:38.31] Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
[32:41.95] My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,
[32:45.23] My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
[32:48.87] (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)
[32:51.79] But the defendant doth that plea deny,
[32:54.34] And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
[32:57.25] To side this title is impanelled
[32:59.44] A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
[33:02.72] And by their verdict is determined
[33:04.90] The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part.
[33:08.91] As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part,
[33:12.55] And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.
@ Sonnet 47
[33:16.19] Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
[33:19.47] And each doth good turns now unto the other,
[33:22.75] When that mine eye is famished for a look,
[33:26.03] Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;
[33:29.31] With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
[33:32.95] And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
[33:35.87] Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
[33:39.15] And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
[33:42.79] So either by thy picture or my love,
[33:45.70] Thy self away, art present still with me,
[33:48.62] For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
[33:51.90] And I am still with them, and they with thee.
[33:55.54] Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
[33:58.82] Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.
@ Sonnet 48
[34:02.46] How careful was I when I took my way,
[34:05.74] Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
[34:08.29] That to my use it might unused stay
[34:11.20] From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
[34:14.48] But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
[34:17.40] Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
[34:19.95] Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
[34:22.86] Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
[34:25.78] Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
[34:29.05] Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
[34:32.70] Within the gentle closure of my breast,
[34:35.25] From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,
[34:38.53] And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
[34:42.17] For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
@ Sonnet 49
[34:45.45] Against that time (if ever that time come)
[34:48.36] When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
[34:51.64] When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
[34:54.92] Called to that audit by advised respects,
[34:57.47] Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
[35:00.38] And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
[35:03.66] When love converted from the thing it was
[35:06.58] Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
[35:08.76] Against that time do I ensconce me here
[35:11.68] Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
[35:14.23] And this my hand, against my self uprear,
[35:17.14] To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,
[35:20.06] To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,
[35:23.70] Since why to love, I can allege no cause.
@ Sonnet 50
[35:26.98] How heavy do I journey on the way,
[35:29.89] When what I seek (my weary travel's end)
[35:33.17] Doth teach that case and that repose to say
[35:36.45] 'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
[35:40.09] The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
[35:43.37] Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
[35:46.65] As if by some instinct the wretch did know
[35:49.93] His rider loved not speed being made from thee:
[35:53.21] The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
[35:55.76] That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
[35:58.31] Which heavily he answers with a groan,
[36:00.86] More sharp to me than spurring to his side,
[36:04.14] For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
[36:07.78] My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
@ Sonnet 51
[36:10.69] Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
[36:13.61] Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,
[36:16.89] From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
[36:20.53] Till I return of posting is no need.
[36:23.44] O what excuse will my poor beast then find,
[36:26.72] When swift extremity can seem but slow?
[36:29.27] Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,
[36:32.55] In winged speed no motion shall I know,
[36:35.47] Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,
[36:38.74] Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)
[36:41.66] Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,
[36:44.94] But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,
[36:48.22] Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
[36:51.13] Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.
@ Sonnet 52
[36:55.14] So am I as the rich whose blessed key,
[36:58.42] Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
[37:01.70] The which he will not every hour survey,
[37:04.61] For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
[37:07.52] Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
[37:10.44] Since seldom coming in that long year set,
[37:13.35] Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
[37:16.27] Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
[37:18.45] So is the time that keeps you as my chest
[37:22.10] Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
[37:25.37] To make some special instant special-blest,
[37:27.93] By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
[37:30.11] Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
[37:32.66] Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.
@ Sonnet 53
[37:35.58] What is your substance, whereof are you made,
[37:38.49] That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
[37:41.40] Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
[37:44.32] And you but one, can every shadow lend:
[37:47.23] Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,
[37:49.05] Is poorly imitated after you,
[37:50.88] On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
[37:54.15] And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
[37:57.07] Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
[38:00.35] The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
[38:03.26] The other as your bounty doth appear,
[38:05.81] And you in every blessed shape we know.
[38:08.73] In all external grace you have some part,
[38:11.64] But you like none, none you for constant heart.
@ Sonnet 54
[38:14.92] O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,
[38:17.83] By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
[38:20.75] The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
[38:24.03] For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:
[38:27.31] The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,
[38:30.58] As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
[38:33.13] Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
[38:36.05] When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
[38:38.96] But for their virtue only is their show,
[38:41.88] They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,
[38:44.06] Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,
[38:46.98] Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
[38:49.89] And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
[38:52.81] When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.
@ Sonnet 55
[38:56.09] Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
[38:58.27] Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
[39:00.82] But you shall shine more bright in these contents
[39:04.10] Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
[39:06.65] When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
[39:08.84] And broils root out the work of masonry,
[39:11.75] Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:
[39:15.76] The living record of your memory.
[39:17.94] 'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
[39:20.49] Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,
[39:24.14] Even in the eyes of all posterity
[39:26.69] That wear this world out to the ending doom.
[39:29.97] So till the judgment that your self arise,
[39:32.88] You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.
@ Sonnet 56
[39:36.16] Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
[39:39.44] Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
[39:41.99] Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
[39:44.90] To-morrow sharpened in his former might.
[39:47.45] So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
[39:50.73] Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
[39:54.01] To-morrow see again, and do not kill
[39:56.92] The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:
[39:59.84] Let this sad interim like the ocean be
[40:02.75] Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,
[40:05.67] Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
[40:08.95] Return of love, more blest may be the view.
[40:12.22] Or call it winter, which being full of care,
[40:15.50] Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
@ Sonnet 57
[40:18.78] Being your slave what should I do but tend,
[40:22.06] Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
[40:24.97] I have no precious time at all to spend;
[40:28.25] Nor services to do till you require.
[40:30.80] Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
[40:34.08] Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
[40:37.36] Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
[40:39.91] When you have bid your servant once adieu.
[40:42.82] Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
[40:45.74] Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
[40:48.65] But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
[40:52.30] Save where you are, how happy you make those.
[40:55.58] So true a fool is love, that in your will,
[40:59.22] (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.
@ Sonnet 58
[41:02.86] That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
[41:06.14] I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
[41:09.42] Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,
[41:13.06] Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.
[41:15.98] O let me suffer (being at your beck)
[41:18.89] Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,
[41:21.08] And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
[41:23.99] Without accusing you of injury.
[41:25.81] Be where you list, your charter is so strong,
[41:29.09] That you your self may privilage your time
[41:32.01] To what you will, to you it doth belong,
[41:35.28] Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.
[41:38.20] I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
[41:41.48] Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.
@ Sonnet 59
[41:44.76] If there be nothing new, but that which is,
[41:48.03] Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
[41:50.95] Which labouring for invention bear amis
[41:53.13] The second burthen of a former child!
[41:55.68] O that record could with a backward look,
[41:58.60] Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
[42:01.51] Show me your image in some antique book,
[42:04.43] Since mind at first in character was done.
[42:07.34] That I might see what the old world could say,
[42:10.99] To this composed wonder of your frame,
[42:13.54] Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
[42:16.45] Or whether revolution be the same.
[42:18.64] O sure I am the wits of former days,
[42:21.91] To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
@ Sonnet 60
[42:24.46] Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
[42:27.74] So do our minutes hasten to their end,
[42:30.66] Each changing place with that which goes before,
[42:33.57] In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
[42:36.12] Nativity once in the main of light,
[42:38.67] Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,
[42:40.86] Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
[42:43.04] And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
[42:46.32] Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
[42:49.24] And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
[42:52.15] Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
[42:55.07] And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
[42:58.34] And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
[43:01.99] Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
@ Sonnet 61
[43:04.54] Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
[43:07.82] My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
[43:10.37] Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
[43:13.28] While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
[43:16.56] Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
[43:20.20] So far from home into my deeds to pry,
[43:23.48] To find out shames and idle hours in me,
[43:26.76] The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
[43:29.31] O no, thy love though much, is not so great,
[43:32.95] It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
[43:36.23] Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
[43:39.51] To play the watchman ever for thy sake.
[43:42.42] For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
[43:45.70] From me far off, with others all too near.
@ Sonnet 62
[43:48.98] Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
[43:51.90] And all my soul, and all my every part;
[43:55.17] And for this sin there is no remedy,
[43:58.09] It is so grounded inward in my heart.
[44:01.00] Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
[44:03.92] No shape so true, no truth of such account,
[44:07.20] And for my self mine own worth do define,
[44:10.48] As I all other in all worths surmount.
[44:13.39] But when my glass shows me my self indeed
[44:16.67] beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,
[44:18.85] Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:
[44:21.77] Self, so self-loving were iniquity.
[44:23.95] 'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
[44:27.96] Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
@ Sonnet 63
[44:30.88] Against my love shall be as I am now
[44:34.15] With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,
[44:37.43] When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
[44:41.08] With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
[44:43.99] Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,
[44:46.91] And all those beauties whereof now he's king
[44:50.18] Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
[44:52.73] Stealing away the treasure of his spring:
[44:55.28] For such a time do I now fortify
[44:58.20] Against confounding age's cruel knife,
[45:00.38] That he shall never cut from memory
[45:02.93] My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
[45:06.58] His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
[45:09.86] And they shall live, and he in them still green.
@ Sonnet 64
[45:13.50] When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
[45:17.14] The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,
[45:20.06] When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,
[45:22.97] And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
[45:25.52] When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
[45:28.44] Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
[45:30.99] And the firm soil win of the watery main,
[45:34.26] Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.
[45:37.18] When I have seen such interchange of State,
[45:40.09] Or state it self confounded, to decay,
[45:42.64] Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
[45:45.19] That Time will come and take my love away.
[45:48.47] This thought is as a death which cannot choose
[45:51.75] But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.
@ Sonnet 65
[45:55.39] Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
[45:58.67] But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
[46:01.22] How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
[46:04.50] Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
[46:07.42] O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
[46:10.69] Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,
[46:13.61] When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
[46:16.16] Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
[46:19.44] O fearful meditation, where alack,
[46:21.26] Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
[46:25.27] Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
[46:28.91] Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
[46:31.82] O none, unless this miracle have might,
[46:34.37] That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
@ Sonnet 66
[46:38.02] Tired with all these for restful death I cry,
[46:41.29] As to behold desert a beggar born,
[46:43.84] And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
[46:46.03] And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
[46:47.85] And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
[46:49.67] And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
[46:51.50] And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
[46:53.32] And strength by limping sway disabled
[46:55.50] And art made tongue-tied by authority,
[46:58.05] And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
[47:00.24] And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
[47:02.06] And captive good attending captain ill.
[47:04.25] Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
[47:07.89] Save that to die, I leave my love alone.
@ Sonnet 67
[47:11.17] Ah wherefore with infection should he live,
[47:13.72] And with his presence grace impiety,
[47:15.90] That sin by him advantage should achieve,
[47:18.45] And lace it self with his society?
[47:21.00] Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
[47:23.55] And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
[47:26.47] Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,
[47:28.65] Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
[47:31.57] Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
[47:34.48] Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
[47:37.40] For she hath no exchequer now but his,
[47:40.31] And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
[47:43.23] O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,
[47:46.87] In days long since, before these last so bad.
@ Sonnet 68
[47:50.15] Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
[47:53.43] When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
[47:56.70] Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
[47:59.62] Or durst inhabit on a living brow:
[48:02.17] Before the golden tresses of the dead,
[48:04.72] The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
[48:07.27] To live a second life on second head,
[48:10.18] Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
[48:13.10] In him those holy antique hours are seen,
[48:16.01] Without all ornament, it self and true,
[48:18.56] Making no summer of another's green,
[48:21.11] Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,
[48:24.03] And him as for a map doth Nature store,
[48:27.31] To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
@ Sonnet 69
[48:30.58] Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,
[48:34.59] Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:
[48:37.87] All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
[48:41.51] Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
[48:44.43] Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
[48:47.34] But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,
[48:50.99] In other accents do this praise confound
[48:53.54] By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
[48:56.45] They look into the beauty of thy mind,
[48:59.36] And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
[49:02.64] Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
[49:05.92] To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
[49:09.56] But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
[49:12.48] The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.
@ Sonnet 70
[49:15.76] That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
[49:19.04] For slander's mark was ever yet the fair,
[49:22.31] The ornament of beauty is suspect,
[49:24.50] A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
[49:27.78] So thou be good, slander doth but approve,
[49:30.69] Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,
[49:33.61] For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
[49:36.52] And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
[49:39.44] Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
[49:42.72] Either not assailed, or victor being charged,
[49:45.27] Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
[49:48.54] To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,
[49:50.73] If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,
[49:54.01] Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
@ Sonnet 71
[49:56.92] No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
[50:00.20] Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
[50:03.12] Give warning to the world that I am fled
[50:06.40] From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
[50:09.67] Nay if you read this line, remember not,
[50:12.59] The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
[50:16.23] That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
[50:19.51] If thinking on me then should make you woe.
[50:22.79] O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
[50:26.07] When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
[50:28.62] Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
[50:31.90] But let your love even with my life decay.
[50:35.17] Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
[50:38.45] And mock you with me after I am gone.
@ Sonnet 72
[50:41.73] O lest the world should task you to recite,
[50:45.01] What merit lived in me that you should love
[50:48.29] After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
[50:51.20] For you in me can nothing worthy prove.
[50:54.12] Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
[50:56.67] To do more for me than mine own desert,
[50:59.95] And hang more praise upon deceased I,
[51:02.50] Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
[51:04.68] O lest your true love may seem false in this,
[51:08.33] That you for love speak well of me untrue,
[51:11.60] My name be buried where my body is,
[51:14.52] And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
[51:18.16] For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
[51:21.80] And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
@ Sonnet 73
[51:25.08] That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
[51:28.36] When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
[51:31.64] Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
[51:34.56] Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
[51:37.83] In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
[51:41.11] As after sunset fadeth in the west,
[51:43.66] Which by and by black night doth take away,
[51:46.94] Death's second self that seals up all in rest.
[51:50.58] In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
[51:53.86] That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
[51:57.14] As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
[52:00.06] Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
[52:02.97] This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
[52:06.61] To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.
@ Sonnet 74
[52:10.26] But be contented when that fell arrest,
[52:12.81] Without all bail shall carry me away,
[52:15.36] My life hath in this line some interest,
[52:18.27] Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
[52:21.19] When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
[52:23.74] The very part was consecrate to thee,
[52:26.29] The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
[52:29.93] My spirit is thine the better part of me,
[52:33.21] So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
[52:36.85] The prey of worms, my body being dead,
[52:39.76] The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
[52:42.68] Too base of thee to be remembered,
[52:45.23] The worth of that, is that which it contains,
[52:48.51] And that is this, and this with thee remains.
@ Sonnet 75
[52:51.79] So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
[52:55.43] Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
[52:58.71] And for the peace of you I hold such strife
[53:02.35] As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
[53:05.63] Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
[53:08.18] Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
[53:11.09] Now counting best to be with you alone,
[53:14.01] Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,
[53:17.29] Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
[53:20.20] And by and by clean starved for a look,
[53:23.48] Possessing or pursuing no delight
[53:25.30] Save what is had, or must from you be took.
[53:28.95] Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
[53:32.22] Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
@ Sonnet 76
[53:34.77] Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
[53:38.05] So far from variation or quick change?
[53:40.60] Why with the time do I not glance aside
[53:43.88] To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
[53:46.80] Why write I still all one, ever the same,
[53:50.07] And keep invention in a noted weed,
[53:52.62] That every word doth almost tell my name,
[53:55.54] Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
[53:58.45] O know sweet love I always write of you,
[54:01.73] And you and love are still my argument:
[54:04.65] So all my best is dressing old words new,
[54:07.93] Spending again what is already spent:
[54:10.11] For as the sun is daily new and old,
[54:13.39] So is my love still telling what is told.
@ Sonnet 77
[54:16.67] Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
[54:19.95] Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,
[54:22.50] These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
[54:25.78] And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
[54:29.05] The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
[54:31.97] Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,
[54:34.52] Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,
[54:37.80] Time's thievish progress to eternity.
[54:39.98] Look what thy memory cannot contain,
[54:42.17] Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
[54:45.45] Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
[54:47.10] To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
[54:50.91] These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
[54:53.83] Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.

[54:56.74] So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,
[55:00.02] And found such fair assistance in my verse,
[55:02.93] As every alien pen hath got my use,
[55:05.85] And under thee their poesy disperse.
[55:08.03] Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,
[55:11.68] And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
[55:13.86] Have added feathers to the learned's wing,
[55:16.78] And given grace a double majesty.
[55:18.96] Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
[55:22.24] Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,
[55:25.16] In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
[55:28.44] And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
[55:31.35] But thou art all my art, and dost advance
[55:34.63] As high as learning, my rude ignorance.
@ Sonnet 79
[55:37.18] Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
[55:40.09] My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
[55:43.01] But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
[55:45.56] And my sick muse doth give an other place.
[55:48.84] I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
[55:51.39] Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
[55:53.94] Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
[55:56.85] He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,
[56:00.13] He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
[56:03.41] From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
[56:05.96] And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
[56:09.24] No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
[56:12.88] Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
[56:16.52] Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.
@ Sonnet 80
[56:20.17] O how I faint when I of you do write,
[56:23.81] Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
[56:26.72] And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
[56:30.00] To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
[56:33.28] But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
[56:36.56] The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
[56:39.47] My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
[56:42.02] On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
[56:44.57] Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
[56:47.49] Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
[56:50.40] Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,
[56:53.32] He of tall building, and of goodly pride.
[56:56.23] Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
[56:59.51] The worst was this, my love was my decay.
@ Sonnet 81
[57:02.79] Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
[57:05.70] Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,
[57:08.98] From hence your memory death cannot take,
[57:11.53] Although in me each part will be forgotten.
[57:14.45] Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
[57:17.36] Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,
[57:21.00] The earth can yield me but a common grave,
[57:24.28] When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,
[57:27.56] Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
[57:30.11] Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
[57:33.39] And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
[57:36.30] When all the breathers of this world are dead,
[57:39.58] You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)
[57:42.86] Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
@ Sonnet 82
[57:46.50] I grant thou wert not married to my muse,
[57:49.78] And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
[57:52.33] The dedicated words which writers use
[57:54.52] Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
[57:57.07] Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
[58:00.35] Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
[58:03.26] And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
[58:05.81] Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
[58:08.73] And do so love, yet when they have devised,
[58:12.01] What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
[58:14.19] Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
[58:16.38] In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
[58:19.66] And their gross painting might be better used,
[58:22.57] Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.
@ Sonnet 83
[58:25.85] I never saw that you did painting need,
[58:28.76] And therefore to your fair no painting set,
[58:31.68] I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,
[58:34.96] That barren tender of a poet's debt:
[58:37.87] And therefore have I slept in your report,
[58:40.78] That you your self being extant well might show,
[58:44.06] How far a modern quill doth come too short,
[58:47.34] Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
[58:50.62] This silence for my sin you did impute,
[58:53.54] Which shall be most my glory being dumb,
[58:56.45] For I impair not beauty being mute,
[58:58.10] When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
[59:02.28] There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,
[59:05.92] Than both your poets can in praise devise.
@ Sonnet 84
[59:08.84] Who is it that says most, which can say more,
[59:12.48] Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?
[59:15.76] In whose confine immured is the store,
[59:18.31] Which should example where your equal grew.
[59:20.86] Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
[59:23.41] That to his subject lends not some small glory,
[59:26.69] But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
[59:30.33] That you are you, so dignifies his story.
[59:33.24] Let him but copy what in you is writ,
[59:36.52] Not making worse what nature made so clear,
[59:39.44] And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
[59:42.35] Making his style admired every where.
[59:44.54] You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
[59:47.45] Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
@ Sonnet 85
[59:50.73] My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,
[59:54.01] While comments of your praise richly compiled,
[59:56.56] Reserve their character with golden quill,
[59:58.74] And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
[01:00:01.66] I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,
[01:00:04.94] And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
[01:00:07.49] To every hymn that able spirit affords,
[01:00:10.04] In polished form of well refined pen.
[01:00:12.59] Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
[01:00:15.87] And to the most of praise add something more,
[01:00:19.15] But that is in my thought, whose love to you
[01:00:22.79] (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,
[01:00:26.07] Then others, for the breath of words respect,
[01:00:28.98] Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
@ Sonnet 86
[01:00:31.90] Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
[01:00:35.54] Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,
[01:00:38.82] That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
[01:00:42.10] Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
[01:00:45.01] Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
[01:00:48.29] Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
[01:00:51.20] No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
[01:00:54.12] Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
[01:00:56.30] He nor that affable familiar ghost
[01:00:58.49] Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
[01:01:00.68] As victors of my silence cannot boast,
[01:01:03.23] I was not sick of any fear from thence.
[01:01:06.50] But when your countenance filled up his line,
[01:01:09.42] Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.
@ Sonnet 87
[01:01:11.97] Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
[01:01:14.88] And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
[01:01:17.80] The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
[01:01:20.71] My bonds in thee are all determinate.
[01:01:23.26] For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
[01:01:26.91] And for that riches where is my deserving?
[01:01:29.82] The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
[01:01:33.46] And so my patent back again is swerving.
[01:01:36.38] Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
[01:01:40.38] Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
[01:01:44.03] So thy great gift upon misprision growing,
[01:01:46.58] Comes home again, on better judgement making.
[01:01:49.13] Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,
[01:01:52.77] In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
@ Sonnet 88
[01:01:56.05] When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
[01:01:59.33] And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
[01:02:02.61] Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,
[01:02:05.88] And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
[01:02:08.80] With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
[01:02:11.35] Upon thy part I can set down a story
[01:02:14.63] Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:
[01:02:17.18] That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:
[01:02:20.46] And I by this will be a gainer too,
[01:02:23.74] For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
[01:02:26.65] The injuries that to my self I do,
[01:02:29.56] Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
[01:02:31.75] Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
[01:02:35.03] That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.
@ Sonnet 89
[01:02:38.67] Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
[01:02:41.95] And I will comment upon that offence,
[01:02:44.50] Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:
[01:02:47.78] Against thy reasons making no defence.
[01:02:49.97] Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
[01:02:53.24] To set a form upon desired change,
[01:02:55.79] As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
[01:02:59.07] I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
[01:03:01.62] Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
[01:03:04.90] Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
[01:03:07.82] Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
[01:03:11.09] And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
[01:03:13.64] For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
[01:03:16.92] For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
@ Sonnet 90
[01:03:20.93] Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
[01:03:24.21] Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
[01:03:27.85] join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
[01:03:31.13] And do not drop in for an after-loss:
[01:03:34.41] Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
[01:03:38.05] Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,
[01:03:40.97] Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
[01:03:43.88] To linger out a purposed overthrow.
[01:03:46.07] If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
[01:03:49.71] When other petty griefs have done their spite,
[01:03:52.62] But in the onset come, so shall I taste
[01:03:55.90] At first the very worst of fortune's might.
[01:03:59.18] And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
[01:04:02.46] Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.
@ Sonnet 91
[01:04:05.74] Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
[01:04:09.02] Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
[01:04:12.66] Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
[01:04:15.58] Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
[01:04:19.22] And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
[01:04:21.77] Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,
[01:04:24.68] But these particulars are not my measure,
[01:04:27.23] All these I better in one general best.
[01:04:30.15] Thy love is better than high birth to me,
[01:04:33.43] Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
[01:04:35.98] Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
[01:04:38.89] And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
[01:04:42.53] Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
[01:04:45.45] All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
@ Sonnet 92
[01:04:48.36] But do thy worst to steal thy self away,
[01:04:51.64] For term of life thou art assured mine,
[01:04:54.56] And life no longer than thy love will stay,
[01:04:57.83] For it depends upon that love of thine.
[01:05:00.75] Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
[01:05:04.39] When in the least of them my life hath end,
[01:05:08.03] I see, a better state to me belongs
[01:05:10.95] Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.
[01:05:13.86] Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
[01:05:16.78] Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,
[01:05:20.06] O what a happy title do I find,
[01:05:22.97] Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
[01:05:25.88] But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
[01:05:29.53] Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
@ Sonnet 93
[01:05:33.17] So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
[01:05:36.09] Like a deceived husband, so love's face,
[01:05:38.100] May still seem love to me, though altered new:
[01:05:42.28] Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
[01:05:45.56] For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
[01:05:48.84] Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,
[01:05:51.75] In many's looks, the false heart's history
[01:05:55.03] Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
[01:05:58.31] But heaven in thy creation did decree,
[01:06:00.86] That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
[01:06:04.14] Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
[01:06:07.78] Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
[01:06:10.69] How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
[01:06:13.97] If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.
@ Sonnet 94
[01:06:16.89] They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
[01:06:20.53] That do not do the thing, they most do show,
[01:06:24.17] Who moving others, are themselves as stone,
[01:06:26.72] Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
[01:06:28.91] They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
[01:06:31.46] And husband nature's riches from expense,
[01:06:34.01] Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,
[01:06:37.29] Others, but stewards of their excellence:
[01:06:39.47] The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
[01:06:42.75] Though to it self, it only live and die,
[01:06:46.03] But if that flower with base infection meet,
[01:06:48.95] The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
[01:06:51.13] For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
[01:06:54.05] Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.
@ Sonnet 95
[01:06:56.96] How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
[01:07:00.24] Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,
[01:07:03.15] Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
[01:07:06.07] O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
[01:07:09.35] That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
[01:07:12.62] (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
[01:07:15.17] Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,
[01:07:18.09] Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
[01:07:20.64] O what a mansion have those vices got,
[01:07:23.55] Which for their habitation chose out thee,
[01:07:26.10] Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
[01:07:29.02] And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
[01:07:32.66] Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,
[01:07:35.58] The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
@ Sonnet 96
[01:07:38.85] Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
[01:07:41.77] Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
[01:07:45.05] Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
[01:07:48.69] Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:
[01:07:51.97] As on the finger of a throned queen,
[01:07:54.88] The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
[01:07:57.43] So are those errors that in thee are seen,
[01:08:00.71] To truths translated, and for true things deemed.
[01:08:03.63] How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
[01:08:06.54] If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
[01:08:09.82] How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
[01:08:12.37] if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
[01:08:16.01] But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
[01:08:19.66] As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
@ Sonnet 97
[01:08:22.93] How like a winter hath my absence been
[01:08:25.85] From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
[01:08:28.76] What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
[01:08:32.04] What old December's bareness everywhere!
[01:08:34.23] And yet this time removed was summer's time,
[01:08:37.51] The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
[01:08:40.06] Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
[01:08:42.61] Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:
[01:08:45.16] Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
[01:08:47.71] But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,
[01:08:50.26] For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
[01:08:53.17] And thou away, the very birds are mute.
[01:08:56.09] Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
[01:08:59.73] That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
@ Sonnet 98
[01:09:03.01] From you have I been absent in the spring,
[01:09:06.29] When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)
[01:09:09.56] Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:
[01:09:12.84] That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
[01:09:15.76] Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
[01:09:19.40] Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
[01:09:22.31] Could make me any summer's story tell:
[01:09:25.23] Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
[01:09:28.87] Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
[01:09:32.15] Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,
[01:09:35.07] They were but sweet, but figures of delight:
[01:09:37.98] Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
[01:09:40.89] Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,
[01:09:43.81] As with your shadow I with these did play.
@ Sonnet 99
[01:09:47.09] The forward violet thus did I chide,
[01:09:49.64] Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
[01:09:53.28] If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
[01:09:56.92] Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,
[01:09:59.84] In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
[01:10:03.48] The lily I condemned for thy hand,
[01:10:06.03] And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,
[01:10:09.31] The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
[01:10:11.86] One blushing shame, another white despair:
[01:10:14.05] A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
[01:10:18.05] And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
[01:10:20.97] But for his theft in pride of all his growth
[01:10:24.61] A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
[01:10:27.52] More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
[01:10:30.80] But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.
@ Sonnet 100
[01:10:34.45] Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
[01:10:38.09] To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
[01:10:41.73] Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
[01:10:45.01] Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
[01:10:47.93] Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
[01:10:50.11] In gentle numbers time so idly spent,
[01:10:52.66] Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,
[01:10:55.94] And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
[01:10:58.85] Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
[01:11:02.13] If time have any wrinkle graven there,
[01:11:04.68] If any, be a satire to decay,
[01:11:07.23] And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
[01:11:09.78] Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
[01:11:13.06] So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.
@ Sonnet 101
[01:11:16.34] O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
[01:11:19.25] For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
[01:11:22.17] Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
[01:11:25.08] So dost thou too, and therein dignified:
[01:11:27.63] Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
[01:11:30.55] 'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
[01:11:33.83] Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:
[01:11:36.74] But best is best, if never intermixed'?
[01:11:39.29] Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
[01:11:42.57] Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,
[01:11:45.85] To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
[01:11:48.76] And to be praised of ages yet to be.
[01:11:52.04] Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,
[01:11:55.32] To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.
@ Sonnet 102
[01:11:58.96] My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
[01:12:02.24] I love not less, though less the show appear,
[01:12:05.52] That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,
[01:12:08.07] The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
[01:12:10.99] Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
[01:12:14.63] When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
[01:12:18.27] As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
[01:12:21.19] And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
[01:12:24.46] Not that the summer is less pleasant now
[01:12:27.38] Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
[01:12:30.66] But that wild music burthens every bough,
[01:12:33.21] And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
[01:12:36.12] Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
[01:12:39.04] Because I would not dull you with my song.
@ Sonnet 103
[01:12:42.31] Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
[01:12:44.86] That having such a scope to show her pride,
[01:12:48.14] The argument all bare is of more worth
[01:12:51.06] Than when it hath my added praise beside.
[01:12:53.97] O blame me not if I no more can write!
[01:12:57.62] Look in your glass and there appears a face,
[01:13:00.89] That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
[01:13:03.44] Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
[01:13:05.99] Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
[01:13:08.91] To mar the subject that before was well?
[01:13:11.82] For to no other pass my verses tend,
[01:13:14.74] Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
[01:13:18.02] And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
[01:13:21.66] Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.
@ Sonnet 104
[01:13:25.30] To me fair friend you never can be old,
[01:13:28.58] For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
[01:13:32.22] Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,
[01:13:35.14] Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
[01:13:38.05] Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
[01:13:40.60] In process of the seasons have I seen,
[01:13:43.52] Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
[01:13:46.43] Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.
[01:13:50.07] Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,
[01:13:52.99] Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,
[01:13:55.90] So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand
[01:13:59.18] Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.
[01:14:02.10] For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,
[01:14:05.37] Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
@ Sonnet 105
[01:14:08.65] Let not my love be called idolatry,
[01:14:11.20] Nor my beloved as an idol show,
[01:14:13.75] Since all alike my songs and praises be
[01:14:16.67] To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
[01:14:19.95] Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
[01:14:23.23] Still constant in a wondrous excellence,
[01:14:25.41] Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
[01:14:27.60] One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
[01:14:29.78] Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,
[01:14:32.70] Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,
[01:14:35.61] And in this change is my invention spent,
[01:14:38.53] Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
[01:14:41.44] Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.
[01:14:44.35] Which three till now, never kept seat in one.
@ Sonnet 106
[01:14:47.63] When in the chronicle of wasted time,
[01:14:50.18] I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
[01:14:52.73] And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
[01:14:54.92] In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
[01:14:57.83] Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
[01:15:01.11] Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
[01:15:04.76] I see their antique pen would have expressed,
[01:15:07.67] Even such a beauty as you master now.
[01:15:10.58] So all their praises are but prophecies
[01:15:13.13] Of this our time, all you prefiguring,
[01:15:15.68] And for they looked but with divining eyes,
[01:15:18.60] They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
[01:15:21.88] For we which now behold these present days,
[01:15:24.79] Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
@ Sonnet 107
[01:15:28.07] Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,
[01:15:30.99] Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,
[01:15:34.26] Can yet the lease of my true love control,
[01:15:37.54] Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
[01:15:40.09] The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
[01:15:42.64] And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
[01:15:45.56] Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
[01:15:47.38] And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
[01:15:49.93] Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
[01:15:53.21] My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
[01:15:56.49] Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,
[01:16:00.49] While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.
[01:16:03.77] And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
[01:16:06.69] When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
@ Sonnet 108
[01:16:09.97] What's in the brain that ink may character,
[01:16:13.24] Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,
[01:16:16.52] What's new to speak, what now to register,
[01:16:19.80] That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
[01:16:23.08] Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,
[01:16:25.99] I must each day say o'er the very same,
[01:16:29.64] Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
[01:16:32.92] Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.
[01:16:36.19] So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
[01:16:39.47] Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
[01:16:42.39] Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
[01:16:44.57] But makes antiquity for aye his page,
[01:16:47.12] Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
[01:16:50.04] Where time and outward form would show it dead.
@ Sonnet 109
[01:16:53.32] O never say that I was false of heart,
[01:16:56.60] Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,
[01:16:59.15] As easy might I from my self depart,
[01:17:02.06] As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
[01:17:05.70] That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
[01:17:09.35] Like him that travels I return again,
[01:17:11.90] Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
[01:17:15.17] So that my self bring water for my stain,
[01:17:18.45] Never believe though in my nature reigned,
[01:17:21.00] All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
[01:17:23.92] That it could so preposterously be stained,
[01:17:26.47] To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:
[01:17:29.75] For nothing this wide universe I call,
[01:17:32.30] Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.
@ Sonnet 110
[01:17:35.94] Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
[01:17:39.22] And made my self a motley to the view,
[01:17:42.50] Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
[01:17:46.14] Made old offences of affections new.
[01:17:48.33] Most true it is, that I have looked on truth
[01:17:51.97] Askance and strangely: but by all above,
[01:17:54.52] These blenches gave my heart another youth,
[01:17:57.07] And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
[01:18:00.35] Now all is done, have what shall have no end,
[01:18:03.99] Mine appetite I never more will grind
[01:18:06.54] On newer proof, to try an older friend,
[01:18:09.46] A god in love, to whom I am confined.
[01:18:12.73] Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
[01:18:16.01] Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
@ Sonnet 111
[01:18:19.29] O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
[01:18:22.57] The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
[01:18:25.12] That did not better for my life provide,
[01:18:28.03] Than public means which public manners breeds.
[01:18:30.58] Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
[01:18:33.86] And almost thence my nature is subdued
[01:18:36.41] To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
[01:18:40.06] Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,
[01:18:42.97] Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,
[01:18:45.88] Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection,
[01:18:48.44] No bitterness that I will bitter think,
[01:18:50.99] Nor double penance to correct correction.
[01:18:53.17] Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,
[01:18:56.45] Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
@ Sonnet 112
[01:18:59.73] Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
[01:19:02.64] Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
[01:19:05.19] For what care I who calls me well or ill,
[01:19:08.84] So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
[01:19:12.48] You are my all the world, and I must strive,
[01:19:16.12] To know my shames and praises from your tongue,
[01:19:19.40] None else to me, nor I to none alive,
[01:19:22.68] That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
[01:19:25.96] In so profound abysm I throw all care
[01:19:28.87] Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,
[01:19:31.79] To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
[01:19:34.34] Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.
[01:19:37.25] You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
[01:19:40.17] That all the world besides methinks are dead.
@ Sonnet 113
[01:19:43.08] Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
[01:19:46.72] And that which governs me to go about,
[01:19:49.64] Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
[01:19:52.55] Seems seeing, but effectually is out:
[01:19:54.74] For it no form delivers to the heart
[01:19:57.65] Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,
[01:20:01.29] Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
[01:20:04.57] Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
[01:20:07.85] For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
[01:20:11.50] The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
[01:20:14.41] The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:
[01:20:17.69] The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
[01:20:21.33] Incapable of more, replete with you,
[01:20:23.52] My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
@ Sonnet 114
[01:20:26.43] Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
[01:20:29.71] Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?
[01:20:32.62] Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
[01:20:35.90] And that your love taught it this alchemy?
[01:20:38.82] To make of monsters, and things indigest,
[01:20:41.37] Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
[01:20:43.92] Creating every bad a perfect best
[01:20:46.10] As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
[01:20:49.02] O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
[01:20:52.30] And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
[01:20:55.58] Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
[01:20:59.22] And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
[01:21:02.13] If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,
[01:21:05.05] That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
@ Sonnet 115
[01:21:08.33] Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
[01:21:11.60] Even those that said I could not love you dearer,
[01:21:15.25] Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,
[01:21:18.16] My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,
[01:21:21.08] But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
[01:21:23.26] Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
[01:21:26.54] Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
[01:21:29.46] Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:
[01:21:33.10] Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
[01:21:35.65] Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
[01:21:39.29] When I was certain o'er incertainty,
[01:21:41.84] Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
[01:21:44.39] Love is a babe, then might I not say so
[01:21:48.03] To give full growth to that which still doth grow.
@ Sonnet 116
[01:21:51.68] Let me not to the marriage of true minds
[01:21:54.96] Admit impediments, love is not love
[01:21:57.14] Which alters when it alteration finds,
[01:21:59.33] Or bends with the remover to remove.
[01:22:01.88] O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
[01:22:04.79] That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
[01:22:07.71] It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
[01:22:10.99] Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
[01:22:14.26] Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
[01:22:18.27] Within his bending sickle's compass come,
[01:22:20.82] Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
[01:22:24.10] But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
[01:22:27.74] If this be error and upon me proved,
[01:22:30.66] I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
@ Sonnet 117
[01:22:33.57] Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
[01:22:36.49] Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
[01:22:39.04] Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
[01:22:41.59] Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
[01:22:44.86] That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
[01:22:47.78] And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
[01:22:51.06] That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
[01:22:54.34] Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
[01:22:57.25] Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
[01:22:59.80] And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
[01:23:01.99] Bring me within the level of your frown,
[01:23:04.90] But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
[01:23:08.18] Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
[01:23:11.46] The constancy and virtue of your love.
@ Sonnet 118
[01:23:14.01] Like as to make our appetite more keen
[01:23:16.92] With eager compounds we our palate urge,
[01:23:19.47] As to prevent our maladies unseen,
[01:23:21.66] We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.
[01:23:24.57] Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
[01:23:28.22] To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
[01:23:31.13] And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,
[01:23:34.41] To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
[01:23:37.69] Thus policy in love t' anticipate
[01:23:39.87] The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,
[01:23:43.15] And brought to medicine a healthful state
[01:23:45.70] Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.
[01:23:48.98] But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
[01:23:52.26] Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.
@ Sonnet 119
[01:23:55.54] What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
[01:23:58.45] Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
[01:24:01.00] Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
[01:24:03.92] Still losing when I saw my self to win!
[01:24:07.20] What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
[01:24:09.75] Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
[01:24:13.03] How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
[01:24:16.67] In the distraction of this madding fever!
[01:24:19.22] O benefit of ill, now I find true
[01:24:22.13] That better is, by evil still made better.
[01:24:25.05] And ruined love when it is built anew
[01:24:27.96] Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
[01:24:31.24] So I return rebuked to my content,
[01:24:33.79] And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
@ Sonnet 120
[01:24:37.43] That you were once unkind befriends me now,
[01:24:40.35] And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
[01:24:43.63] Needs must I under my transgression bow,
[01:24:46.18] Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
[01:24:49.09] For if you were by my unkindness shaken
[01:24:52.01] As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,
[01:24:56.01] And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
[01:24:58.93] To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
[01:25:02.21] O that our night of woe might have remembered
[01:25:05.48] My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
[01:25:08.40] And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
[01:25:12.04] The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
[01:25:14.59] But that your trespass now becomes a fee,
[01:25:17.51] Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
@ Sonnet 121
[01:25:20.42] 'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
[01:25:23.70] When not to be, receives reproach of being,
[01:25:26.61] And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
[01:25:29.89] Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.
[01:25:32.81] For why should others' false adulterate eyes
[01:25:35.36] Give salutation to my sportive blood?
[01:25:37.54] Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
[01:25:40.46] Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
[01:25:44.10] No, I am that I am, and they that level
[01:25:47.74] At my abuses, reckon up their own,
[01:25:50.29] I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
[01:25:53.57] By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown
[01:25:57.21] Unless this general evil they maintain,
[01:25:59.40] All men are bad and in their badness reign.
@ Sonnet 122
[01:26:02.68] Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
[01:26:05.59] Full charactered with lasting memory,
[01:26:07.42] Which shall above that idle rank remain
[01:26:09.97] Beyond all date even to eternity.
[01:26:12.15] Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
[01:26:15.79] Have faculty by nature to subsist,
[01:26:17.98] Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
[01:26:20.89] Of thee, thy record never can be missed:
[01:26:23.81] That poor retention could not so much hold,
[01:26:26.72] Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,
[01:26:30.00] Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
[01:26:33.28] To trust those tables that receive thee more:
[01:26:36.19] To keep an adjunct to remember thee
[01:26:38.74] Were to import forgetfulness in me.
@ Sonnet 123
[01:26:40.93] No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,
[01:26:44.57] Thy pyramids built up with newer might
[01:26:47.12] To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,
[01:26:49.67] They are but dressings Of a former sight:
[01:26:52.59] Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,
[01:26:55.50] What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
[01:26:58.78] And rather make them born to our desire,
[01:27:01.70] Than think that we before have heard them told:
[01:27:04.97] Thy registers and thee I both defy,
[01:27:07.52] Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,
[01:27:10.80] For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
[01:27:14.08] Made more or less by thy continual haste:
[01:27:16.100] This I do vow and this shall ever be,
[01:27:20.27] I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.

[01:27:23.55] If my dear love were but the child of state,
[01:27:27.20] It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,
[01:27:30.11] As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
[01:27:34.12] Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
[01:27:37.03] No it was builded far from accident,
[01:27:39.58] It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
[01:27:42.50] Under the blow of thralled discontent,
[01:27:44.68] Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
[01:27:47.23] It fears not policy that heretic,
[01:27:49.42] Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,
[01:27:52.33] But all alone stands hugely politic,
[01:27:54.52] That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
[01:27:58.16] To this I witness call the fools of time,
[01:28:01.44] Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.

[01:28:04.72] Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
[01:28:07.100] With my extern the outward honouring,
[01:28:10.18] Or laid great bases for eternity,
[01:28:12.37] Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
[01:28:15.28] Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
[01:28:18.56] Lose all, and more by paying too much rent
[01:28:21.84] For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
[01:28:24.03] Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?
[01:28:26.21] No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
[01:28:29.13] And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
[01:28:32.04] Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,
[01:28:35.32] But mutual render, only me for thee.
[01:28:37.87] Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul
[01:28:40.42] When most impeached, stands least in thy control.
@ Sonnet 126
[01:28:43.33] O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
[01:28:46.61] Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:
[01:28:49.89] Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,
[01:28:53.17] Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
[01:28:56.45] If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
[01:28:58.64] As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
[01:29:01.91] She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
[01:29:05.19] May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
[01:29:07.74] Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
[01:29:11.02] She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
[01:29:14.30] Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
[01:29:16.85] And her quietus is to render thee.
@ Sonnet 127
[01:29:19.40] In the old age black was not counted fair,
[01:29:22.68] Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:
[01:29:26.32] But now is black beauty's successive heir,
[01:29:29.24] And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,
[01:29:31.79] For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
[01:29:35.43] Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,
[01:29:38.71] Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
[01:29:41.62] But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
[01:29:44.54] Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
[01:29:47.09] Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
[01:29:50.00] At such who not born fair no beauty lack,
[01:29:53.28] Slandering creation with a false esteem,
[01:29:55.47] Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
[01:29:58.38] That every tongue says beauty should look so.
@ Sonnet 128
[01:30:01.29] How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
[01:30:04.57] Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
[01:30:07.12] With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
[01:30:10.40] The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
[01:30:12.95] Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
[01:30:15.87] To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
[01:30:18.78] Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
[01:30:22.06] At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
[01:30:25.34] To be so tickled they would change their state
[01:30:28.62] And situation with those dancing chips,
[01:30:30.80] O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
[01:30:34.08] Making dead wood more blest than living lips,
[01:30:36.100] Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
[01:30:39.91] Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
@ Sonnet 129
[01:30:43.19] Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
[01:30:46.47] Is lust in action, and till action, lust
[01:30:49.38] Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,
[01:30:52.30] Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
[01:30:54.85] Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
[01:30:57.03] Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
[01:30:59.58] Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,
[01:31:02.13] On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
[01:31:05.05] Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
[01:31:07.60] Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,
[01:31:10.51] A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
[01:31:13.79] Before a joy proposed behind a dream.
[01:31:16.34] All this the world well knows yet none knows well,
[01:31:19.98] To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
@ Sonnet 130
[01:31:23.63] My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
[01:31:26.54] Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
[01:31:29.82] If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
[01:31:33.46] If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:
[01:31:37.11] I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
[01:31:40.02] But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
[01:31:43.30] And in some perfumes is there more delight,
[01:31:46.21] Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
[01:31:49.49] I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
[01:31:53.13] That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
[01:31:56.05] I grant I never saw a goddess go,
[01:31:58.96] My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
[01:32:02.24] And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
[01:32:05.88] As any she belied with false compare.
@ Sonnet 131
[01:32:08.44] Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
[01:32:11.35] As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
[01:32:14.26] For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
[01:32:17.91] Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
[01:32:20.82] Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
[01:32:24.10] Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
[01:32:27.74] To say they err, I dare not be so bold,
[01:32:31.39] Although I swear it to my self alone.
[01:32:34.30] And to be sure that is not false I swear,
[01:32:37.94] A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
[01:32:40.86] One on another's neck do witness bear
[01:32:43.77] Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
[01:32:47.05] In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
[01:32:50.33] And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
@ Sonnet 132
[01:32:53.24] Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
[01:32:56.52] Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
[01:32:59.07] Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
[01:33:01.99] Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
[01:33:04.54] And truly not the morning sun of heaven
[01:33:07.45] Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
[01:33:10.37] Nor that full star that ushers in the even
[01:33:13.64] Doth half that glory to the sober west
[01:33:16.56] As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
[01:33:19.47] O let it then as well beseem thy heart
[01:33:22.75] To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
[01:33:26.03] And suit thy pity like in every part.
[01:33:28.95] Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
[01:33:31.86] And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
@ Sonnet 133
[01:33:34.77] Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
[01:33:38.05] For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
[01:33:41.70] Is't not enough to torture me alone,
[01:33:44.61] But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
[01:33:48.25] Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,
[01:33:51.53] And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,
[01:33:54.45] Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,
[01:33:57.72] A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
[01:34:01.00] Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
[01:34:04.28] But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,
[01:34:08.29] Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,
[01:34:11.93] Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
[01:34:15.21] And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,
[01:34:18.85] Perforce am thine and all that is in me.
@ Sonnet 134
[01:34:22.13] So now I have confessed that he is thine,
[01:34:25.41] And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
[01:34:28.69] My self I'll forfeit, so that other mine,
[01:34:31.97] Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
[01:34:34.88] But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
[01:34:38.53] For thou art covetous, and he is kind,
[01:34:41.44] He learned but surety-like to write for me,
[01:34:44.72] Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
[01:34:47.100] The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
[01:34:50.91] Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,
[01:34:54.19] And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
[01:34:57.47] So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
[01:35:00.38] Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,
[01:35:04.03] He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.
@ Sonnet 135
[01:35:07.67] Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
[01:35:10.58] And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,
[01:35:13.86] More than enough am I that vex thee still,
[01:35:17.14] To thy sweet will making addition thus.
[01:35:19.69] Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,
[01:35:22.61] Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
[01:35:25.88] Shall will in others seem right gracious,
[01:35:28.44] And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
[01:35:31.35] The sea all water, yet receives rain still,
[01:35:34.26] And in abundance addeth to his store,
[01:35:36.81] So thou being rich in will add to thy will
[01:35:40.46] One will of mine to make thy large will more.
[01:35:44.10] Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,
[01:35:46.65] Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'
@ Sonnet 136
[01:35:50.29] If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
[01:35:53.94] Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
[01:35:57.58] And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
[01:36:00.49] Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.
[01:36:03.77] 'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
[01:36:07.05] Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,
[01:36:10.69] In things of great receipt with case we prove,
[01:36:13.97] Among a number one is reckoned none.
[01:36:16.52] Then in the number let me pass untold,
[01:36:19.44] Though in thy store's account I one must be,
[01:36:23.08] For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,
[01:36:26.36] That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.
[01:36:29.27] Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
[01:36:32.92] And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.
@ Sonnet 137
[01:36:36.92] Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
[01:36:40.57] That they behold and see not what they see?
[01:36:43.84] They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
[01:36:47.12] Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.
[01:36:50.77] If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,
[01:36:53.32] Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,
[01:36:56.60] Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
[01:36:59.51] Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
[01:37:02.42] Why should my heart think that a several plot,
[01:37:05.70] Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
[01:37:09.35] Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not
[01:37:12.62] To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
[01:37:15.90] In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
[01:37:19.55] And to this false plague are they now transferred.
@ Sonnet 138
[01:37:22.82] When my love swears that she is made of truth,
[01:37:26.47] I do believe her though I know she lies,
[01:37:29.75] That she might think me some untutored youth,
[01:37:32.66] Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
[01:37:35.21] Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
[01:37:38.13] Although she knows my days are past the best,
[01:37:41.40] Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,
[01:37:43.95] On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
[01:37:46.87] But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
[01:37:49.78] And wherefore say not I that I am old?
[01:37:53.06] O love's best habit is in seeming trust,
[01:37:56.34] And age in love, loves not to have years told.
[01:37:59.98] Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
[01:38:03.26] And in our faults by lies we flattered be.
@ Sonnet 139
[01:38:06.54] O call not me to justify the wrong,
[01:38:09.46] That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,
[01:38:12.01] Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,
[01:38:15.65] Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
[01:38:19.29] Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
[01:38:22.93] Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,
[01:38:25.85] What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
[01:38:29.49] Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?
[01:38:32.77] Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
[01:38:36.05] Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
[01:38:38.60] And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
[01:38:41.88] That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
[01:38:44.43] Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,
[01:38:48.07] Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.
@ Sonnet 140
[01:38:51.35] Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
[01:38:54.63] My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:
[01:38:57.54] Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,
[01:39:00.46] The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
[01:39:03.01] If I might teach thee wit better it were,
[01:39:06.29] Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
[01:39:09.93] As testy sick men when their deaths be near,
[01:39:13.21] No news but health from their physicians know.
[01:39:16.12] For if I should despair I should grow mad,
[01:39:19.40] And in my madness might speak ill of thee,
[01:39:22.68] Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
[01:39:25.96] Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
[01:39:28.51] That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
[01:39:31.79] Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
@ Sonnet 141
[01:39:35.43] In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
[01:39:39.07] For they in thee a thousand errors note,
[01:39:41.99] But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
[01:39:45.27] Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
[01:39:48.54] Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,
[01:39:52.19] Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
[01:39:54.74] Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
[01:39:57.65] To any sensual feast with thee alone:
[01:40:00.20] But my five wits, nor my five senses can
[01:40:03.48] Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
[01:40:06.03] Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
[01:40:08.95] Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
[01:40:12.59] Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
[01:40:15.87] That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.
@ Sonnet 142
[01:40:19.15] Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
[01:40:22.42] Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
[01:40:25.34] O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
[01:40:28.62] And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
[01:40:31.53] Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
[01:40:35.17] That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,
[01:40:37.36] And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
[01:40:41.00] Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
[01:40:43.55] Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,
[01:40:47.56] Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,
[01:40:50.48] Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,
[01:40:53.75] Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
[01:40:56.30] If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
[01:40:59.95] By self-example mayst thou be denied.
@ Sonnet 143
[01:41:02.50] Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,
[01:41:05.41] One of her feathered creatures broke away,
[01:41:07.96] Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
[01:41:11.24] In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
[01:41:14.52] Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
[01:41:17.43] Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,
[01:41:20.71] To follow that which flies before her face:
[01:41:23.63] Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
[01:41:26.18] So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,
[01:41:29.82] Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,
[01:41:32.73] But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
[01:41:36.38] And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.
[01:41:40.02] So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,
[01:41:43.66] If thou turn back and my loud crying still.
@ Sonnet 144
[01:41:46.94] Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
[01:41:49.86] Which like two spirits do suggest me still,
[01:41:52.77] The better angel is a man right fair:
[01:41:55.68] The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
[01:41:58.23] To win me soon to hell my female evil,
[01:42:01.51] Tempteth my better angel from my side,
[01:42:04.06] And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
[01:42:07.34] Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
[01:42:09.89] And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
[01:42:12.81] Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
[01:42:15.36] But being both from me both to each friend,
[01:42:18.64] I guess one angel in another's hell.
[01:42:21.55] Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,
[01:42:25.56] Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
@ Sonnet 145
[01:42:28.84] Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
[01:42:32.11] Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
[01:42:35.03] To me that languished for her sake:
[01:42:37.58] But when she saw my woeful state,
[01:42:40.13] Straight in her heart did mercy come,
[01:42:42.68] Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
[01:42:44.86] Was used in giving gentle doom:
[01:42:47.05] And taught it thus anew to greet:
[01:42:49.60] 'I hate' she altered with an end,
[01:42:52.52] That followed it as gentle day,
[01:42:54.70] Doth follow night who like a fiend
[01:42:57.25] From heaven to hell is flown away.
[01:42:59.80] 'I hate', from hate away she threw,
[01:43:02.72] And saved my life saying 'not you'.
@ Sonnet 146
[01:43:05.27] Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,
[01:43:08.18] My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
[01:43:10.73] Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
[01:43:13.64] Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
[01:43:16.19] Why so large cost having so short a lease,
[01:43:19.47] Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
[01:43:22.02] Shall worms inheritors of this excess
[01:43:24.21] Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
[01:43:27.85] Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,
[01:43:31.13] And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
[01:43:34.05] Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
[01:43:36.96] Within be fed, without be rich no more,
[01:43:39.87] So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,
[01:43:43.52] And death once dead, there's no more dying then.
@ Sonnet 147
[01:43:47.16] My love is as a fever longing still,
[01:43:50.07] For that which longer nurseth the disease,
[01:43:52.62] Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
[01:43:55.54] Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:
[01:43:57.72] My reason the physician to my love,
[01:44:00.27] Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
[01:44:02.82] Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,
[01:44:05.74] Desire is death, which physic did except.
[01:44:08.29] Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
[01:44:11.57] And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
[01:44:13.75] My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,
[01:44:17.40] At random from the truth vainly expressed.
[01:44:19.95] For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
[01:44:23.59] Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
@ Sonnet 148
[01:44:27.23] O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
[01:44:30.88] Which have no correspondence with true sight,
[01:44:33.43] Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
[01:44:36.70] That censures falsely what they see aright?
[01:44:39.25] If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
[01:44:42.53] What means the world to say it is not so?
[01:44:46.18] If it be not, then love doth well denote,
[01:44:49.46] Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
[01:44:53.83] How can it? O how can love's eye be true,
[01:44:57.83] That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
[01:45:01.11] No marvel then though I mistake my view,
[01:45:04.03] The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.
[01:45:07.31] O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,
[01:45:10.95] Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
@ Sonnet 149
[01:45:14.23] Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,
[01:45:17.51] When I against my self with thee partake?
[01:45:20.42] Do I not think on thee when I forgot
[01:45:23.70] Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
[01:45:26.98] Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
[01:45:30.26] On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
[01:45:33.90] Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
[01:45:37.91] Revenge upon my self with present moan?
[01:45:40.46] What merit do I in my self respect,
[01:45:43.37] That is so proud thy service to despise,
[01:45:46.29] When all my best doth worship thy defect,
[01:45:49.20] Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
[01:45:51.75] But love hate on for now I know thy mind,
[01:45:55.39] Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.
@ Sonnet 150
[01:45:59.40] O from what power hast thou this powerful might,
[01:46:02.68] With insufficiency my heart to sway,
[01:46:04.86] To make me give the lie to my true sight,
[01:46:08.51] And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
[01:46:11.79] Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
[01:46:14.70] That in the very refuse of thy deeds,
[01:46:17.62] There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
[01:46:20.53] That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
[01:46:23.81] Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
[01:46:27.45] The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
[01:46:31.09] O though I love what others do abhor,
[01:46:34.01] With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
[01:46:36.92] If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
[01:46:39.47] More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
@ Sonnet 151
[01:46:42.39] Love is too young to know what conscience is,
[01:46:45.67] Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
[01:46:48.95] Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
[01:46:51.50] Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
[01:46:54.77] For thou betraying me, I do betray
[01:46:57.32] My nobler part to my gross body's treason,
[01:47:00.60] My soul doth tell my body that he may,
[01:47:03.88] Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
[01:47:06.80] But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
[01:47:10.07] As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,
[108:45.08]He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
[108:47.70]To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
[108:53.58]No want of conscience hold it that I call,
[108:55.69]Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.
@ Sonnet 152
[109:06.71]In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
[109:09.78]But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
[109:13.61]In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
[109:17.07]In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
[109:21.68]But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
[109:24.11]When I break twenty? I am perjured most,
[109:26.47]For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
[109:31.28]And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
[109:34.54]For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
[109:38.26]Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
[109:41.91]And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
[109:45.30]Or made them swear against the thing they see.
[109:49.71]For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,
[109:55.28]To swear against the truth so foul a be.

[01:49:55.28] Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,
[01:49:58.19] A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
[01:50:01.11] And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
[01:50:04.02] In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:
[01:50:06.94] Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
[01:50:09.85] A dateless lively heat still to endure,
[01:50:12.40] And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
[01:50:15.68] Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:
[01:50:17.87] But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
[01:50:21.51] The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,
[01:50:24.79] I sick withal the help of bath desired,
[01:50:27.70] And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
[01:50:30.25] But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,
[01:50:33.90] Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.
@ Sonnet 154
[01:50:36.81] The little Love-god lying once asleep,
[01:50:39.36] Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
[01:50:42.27] Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
[01:50:45.55] Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,
[01:50:48.47] The fairest votary took up that fire,
[01:50:51.02] Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,
[01:50:53.93] And so the general of hot desire,
[01:50:56.48] Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.
[01:50:59.03] This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
[01:51:02.31] Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
[01:51:05.23] Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
[01:51:07.41] For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,
[01:51:10.33] Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
[01:51:13.97] Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
