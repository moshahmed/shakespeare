[00:00.36]	[Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.,]
[00:01.08]	[Enter CLEON and DIONYZA]
[00:01.80]DIONYZA	Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?
[00:04.38]CLEON	O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
[00:06.90]	The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!
[00:09.36]DIONYZA	I think
[00:10.20]	You'll turn a child again.
[00:12.12]CLEON	Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
[00:15.18]	I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,
[00:17.76]	Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
[00:20.88]	To equal any single crown o' the earth
[00:23.52]	I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
[00:26.47]	Whom thou hast poison'd too:
[00:28.51]	If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
[00:31.81]	Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
[00:34.75]	When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
[00:37.69]DIONYZA	That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
[00:40.57]	To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
[00:42.97]	She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
[00:46.15]	Unless you play the pious innocent,
[00:48.61]	And for an honest attribute cry out
[00:51.14]	'She died by foul play.'
[00:52.82]CLEON	O, go to. Well, well,
[00:54.26]	Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
[00:57.44]	Do like this worst.
[00:58.94]DIONYZA	Be one of those that think
[01:00.92]	The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
[01:03.74]	And open this to Pericles. I do shame
[01:06.32]	To think of what a noble strain you are,
[01:09.08]	And of how coward a spirit.
[01:11.06]CLEON	To such proceeding
[01:12.56]	Who ever but his approbation added,
[01:15.03]	Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
[01:18.09]	From honourable sources.
[01:19.89]DIONYZA	Be it so, then:
[01:21.09]	Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
[01:24.15]	Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
[01:26.73]	She did disdain my child, and stood between
[01:29.67]	Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
[01:32.67]	But cast their gazes on Marina's face;
[01:35.31]	Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
[01:38.38]	Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
[01:41.62]	And though you call my course unnatural,
[01:44.38]	You not your child well loving, yet I find
[01:47.26]	It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
[01:50.14]	Perform'd to your sole daughter.
[01:52.42]CLEON	Heavens forgive it!
[01:53.92]DIONYZA	And as for Pericles,
[01:55.48]	What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
[01:58.48]	And yet we mourn: her monument
[02:00.64]	Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
[02:03.17]	In glittering golden characters express
[02:05.93]	A general praise to her, and care in us
[02:08.63]	At whose expense 'tis done.
[02:10.55]CLEON	Thou art like the harpy,
[02:12.35]	Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,
[02:15.41]	Seize with thine eagle's talons.
[02:17.69]DIONYZA	You are like one that superstitiously
[02:20.33]	Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:
[02:23.75]	But yet I know you'll do as I advise.
[02:26.33]	[Exeunt]
