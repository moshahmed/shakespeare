[00:00.51]	[ACT V, Prologue - Dispersedly in various countries.]
[00:01.55]	[Enter GOWER]
[00:02.59]GOWER	Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
[00:06.82]	Into an honest house, our story says.
[00:10.45]	She sings like one immortal, and she dances
[00:14.69]	As goddess-like to her admired lays;
[00:18.32]	Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes
[00:23.24]	Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
[00:27.82]	That even her art sisters the natural roses;
[00:32.14]	Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
[00:36.38]	That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
[00:40.44]	Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
[00:44.59]	She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
[00:48.91]	And to her father turn our thoughts again,
[00:53.06]	Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;
[00:57.64]	Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
[01:02.04]	Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
[01:06.80]	Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
[01:11.03]	God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
[01:15.61]	Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
[01:19.07]	His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
[01:23.39]	And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
[01:27.45]	In your supposing once more put your sight
[01:31.69]	Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
[01:35.49]	Where what is done in action, more, if might,
[01:39.72]	Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
[01:44.04]	[Exit]
