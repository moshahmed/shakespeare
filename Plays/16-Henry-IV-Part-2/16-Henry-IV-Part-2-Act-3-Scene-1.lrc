[00:00.42]	[Westminster. The palace.,]
[00:01.28]	[Enter KING HENRY IV in his nightgown, with a Page]
[00:02.13]KING HENRY IV	Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;
[00:05.63]	But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,
[00:09.69]	And well consider of them; make good speed.
[00:13.11]	[Exit Page]
[00:13.97]	How many thousand of my poorest subjects
[00:17.32]	Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,
[00:21.09]	Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
[00:24.73]	That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
[00:28.36]	And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
[00:31.43]	Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
[00:34.92]	Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
[00:37.91]	And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
[00:41.98]	Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
[00:45.47]	Under the canopies of costly state,
[00:48.39]	And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
[00:51.74]	O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile
[00:55.38]	In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch
[00:59.15]	A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?
[01:02.15]	Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
[01:05.36]	Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
[01:09.20]	In cradle of the rude imperious surge
[01:12.34]	And in the visitation of the winds,
[01:15.26]	Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
[01:18.54]	Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
[01:22.32]	With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,
[01:26.03]	That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?
[01:29.30]	Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
[01:32.80]	To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
[01:35.93]	And in the calmest and most stillest night,
[01:39.42]	With all appliances and means to boot,
[01:42.56]	Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!
[01:45.98]	Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
[01:49.26]	[Enter WARWICK and SURREY]
[01:50.12]WARWICK	Many good morrows to your majesty!
[01:52.97]KING HENRY IV	Is it good morrow, lords?
[01:55.11]WARWICK	'Tis one o'clock, and past.
[01:57.32]KING HENRY IV	Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.
[02:00.67]	Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?
[02:04.44]WARWICK	We have, my liege.
[02:06.08]KING HENRY IV	Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
[02:09.50]	How foul it is; what rank diseases grow
[02:12.71]	And with what danger, near the heart of it.
[02:16.13]WARWICK	It is but as a body yet distemper'd;
[02:19.13]	Which to his former strength may be restored
[02:22.76]	With good advice and little medicine:
[02:25.83]	My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.
[02:29.32]KING HENRY IV	O God! that one might read the book of fate,
[02:32.81]	And see the revolution of the times
[02:35.80]	Make mountains level, and the continent,
[02:39.01]	Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
[02:42.01]	Into the sea! and, other times, to see
[02:45.00]	The beachy girdle of the ocean
[02:47.64]	Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,
[02:51.27]	And changes fill the cup of alteration
[02:54.48]	With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
[02:57.76]	The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,
[03:01.61]	What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
[03:04.81]	Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.
[03:08.45]	'Tis not 'ten years gone
[03:10.52]	Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
[03:14.29]	Did feast together, and in two years after
[03:17.71]	Were they at wars: it is but eight years since
[03:21.42]	This Percy was the man nearest my soul,
[03:24.63]	Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
[03:27.91]	And laid his love and life under my foot,
[03:31.26]	Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
[03:34.82]	Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--
[03:38.24]	You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--
[03:41.16]	[To WARWICK]
[03:42.02]	When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,
[03:45.51]	Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,
[03:48.93]	Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?
[03:52.50]	'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which
[03:55.78]	My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'
[03:59.05]	Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,
[04:02.55]	But that necessity so bow'd the state
[04:05.68]	That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:
[04:09.25]	'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,
[04:12.67]	'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,
[04:16.52]	Shall break into corruption:' so went on,
[04:19.72]	Foretelling this same time's condition
[04:22.93]	And the division of our amity.
[04:25.50]WARWICK	There is a history in all men's lives,
[04:28.63]	Figuring the nature of the times deceased;
[04:32.06]	The which observed, a man may prophesy,
[04:35.19]	With a near aim, of the main chance of things
[04:38.83]	As yet not come to life, which in their seeds
[04:42.46]	And weak beginnings lie intreasured.
[04:45.46]	Such things become the hatch and brood of time;
[04:49.23]	And by the necessary form of this
[04:52.08]	King Richard might create a perfect guess
[04:55.51]	That great Northumberland, then false to him,
[04:59.07]	Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;
[05:02.85]	Which should not find a ground to root upon,
[05:06.41]	Unless on you.
[05:07.84]KING HENRY IV	Are these things then necessities?
[05:10.69]	Then let us meet them like necessities:
[05:13.89]	And that same word even now cries out on us:
[05:17.46]	They say the bishop and Northumberland
[05:20.67]	Are fifty thousand strong.
[05:22.95]WARWICK	It cannot be, my lord;
[05:24.87]	Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,
[05:28.36]	The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace
[05:32.14]	To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,
[05:34.99]	The powers that you already have sent forth
[05:38.56]	Shall bring this prize in very easily.
[05:41.69]	To comfort you the more, I have received
[05:44.97]	A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
[05:48.39]	Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,
[05:51.81]	And these unseason'd hours perforce must add
[05:55.45]	Unto your sickness.
[05:57.23]KING HENRY IV	I will take your counsel:
[05:59.44]	And were these inward wars once out of hand,
[06:03.00]	We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.
[06:06.21]	[Exeunt]
