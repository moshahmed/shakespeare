[00:00.42]	[Cyprus. A street.,]
[00:01.28]	[Enter IAGO and RODERIGO]
[00:02.14]IAGO	Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
[00:06.13]	Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
[00:09.56]	Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
[00:13.27]	It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
[00:16.55]	And fix most firm thy resolution.
[00:19.34]RODERIGO	Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
[00:22.33]IAGO	Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
[00:25.90]	[Retires]
[00:26.76]RODERIGO	I have no great devotion to the deed;
[00:29.83]	And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
[00:33.40]	'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.
[00:36.82]IAGO	I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
[00:40.82]	And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
[00:44.53]	Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
[00:47.81]	Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
[00:50.95]	He calls me to a restitution large
[00:53.88]	Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
[00:57.30]	As gifts to Desdemona;
[00:59.30]	It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
[01:02.23]	He hath a daily beauty in his life
[01:05.16]	That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
[01:08.44]	May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
[01:12.36]	No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.
[01:15.65]	[Enter CASSIO]
[01:16.50]RODERIGO	I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!
[01:19.93]	[Makes a pass at CASSIO]
[01:20.78]CASSIO	That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
[01:24.00]	But that my coat is better than thou know'st
[01:27.64]	I will make proof of thine.
[01:29.99]	[Draws, and wounds RODERIGO]
[01:30.85]RODERIGO	O, I am slain!
[01:32.20]	[IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit]
[01:33.06]CASSIO	I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!
[01:36.56]	[Falls]
[01:37.41]	[Enter OTHELLO]
[01:38.27]OTHELLO	The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.
[01:41.55]RODERIGO	O, villain that I am!
[01:43.41]OTHELLO	It is even so.
[01:44.84]CASSIO	O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!
[01:47.12]OTHELLO	'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
[01:50.12]	That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
[01:54.04]	Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
[01:57.61]	And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
[02:01.11]	Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
[02:05.39]	Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.
[02:09.82]	[Exit]
[02:10.67]	[Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO]
[02:11.53]CASSIO	What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!
[02:14.95]GRATIANO	'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
[02:18.45]CASSIO	O, help!
[02:19.38]LODOVICO	Hark!
[02:20.16]RODERIGO	O wretched villain!
[02:21.95]LODOVICO	Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
[02:25.16]	These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
[02:28.94]	To come in to the cry without more help.
[02:32.23]RODERIGO	Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
[02:35.51]LODOVICO	Hark!
[02:36.29]	[Re-enter IAGO, with a light]
[02:37.15]GRATIANO	Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
[02:41.36]IAGO	Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?
[02:45.50]LODOVICO	We do not know.
[02:47.00]IAGO	Did not you hear a cry?
[02:49.07]CASSIO	Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
[02:52.07]IAGO	What's the matter?
[02:53.78]GRATIANO	This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
[02:56.99]LODOVICO	The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
[03:00.13]IAGO	What are you here that cry so grievously?
[03:03.49]CASSIO	Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
[03:06.70]	Give me some help.
[03:08.41]IAGO	O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?
[03:12.05]CASSIO	I think that one of them is hereabout,
[03:15.19]	And cannot make away.
[03:17.12]IAGO	O treacherous villains!
[03:19.19]	What are you there? come in, and give some help.
[03:22.90]	[To LODOVICO and GRATIANO]
[03:23.75]RODERIGO	O, help me here!
[03:25.25]CASSIO	That's one of them.
[03:27.04]IAGO	O murderous slave! O villain!
[03:29.46]	[Stabs RODERIGO]
[03:30.32]RODERIGO	O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
[03:32.75]IAGO	Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
[03:36.74]	How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
[03:40.10]	What may you be? are you of good or evil?
[03:43.38]LODOVICO	As you shall prove us, praise us.
[03:46.09]IAGO	Signior Lodovico?
[03:47.73]LODOVICO	He, sir.
[03:48.66]IAGO	I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
[03:52.44]GRATIANO	Cassio!
[03:53.37]IAGO	How is't, brother!
[03:55.01]CASSIO	My leg is cut in two.
[03:56.94]IAGO	Marry, heaven forbid!
[03:58.80]	Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
[04:02.29]	[Enter BIANCA]
[04:03.15]BIANCA	What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?
[04:06.58]IAGO	Who is't that cried!
[04:08.43]BIANCA	O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
[04:11.86]	Cassio, Cassio!
[04:13.28]IAGO	O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
[04:16.71]	Who they should be that have thus many led you?
[04:20.49]CASSIO	No.
[04:21.13]GRATIANO	I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.
[04:24.85]IAGO	Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
[04:27.70]	To bear him easily hence!
[04:29.91]BIANCA	Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
[04:33.05]IAGO	Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
[04:36.19]	To be a party in this injury.
[04:38.69]	Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
[04:41.83]	Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
[04:45.11]	Alas my friend and my dear countryman
[04:48.26]	Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.
[04:51.47]GRATIANO	What, of Venice?
[04:52.97]IAGO	Even he, sir; did you know him?
[04:55.46]GRATIANO	Know him! ay.
[04:56.75]IAGO	Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
[05:00.10]	These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
[05:03.81]	That so neglected you.
[05:05.81]GRATIANO	I am glad to see you.
[05:07.74]IAGO	How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
[05:10.74]GRATIANO	Roderigo!
[05:11.81]IAGO	He, he 'tis he.
[05:13.16]	[A chair brought in]
[05:14.02]	O, that's well said; the chair!
[05:16.52]GRATIANO	Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
[05:20.09]	I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
[05:22.87]	[To BIANCA]
[05:23.73]	For you, mistress,
[05:25.37]	Save you your labour. He that lies slain
[05:28.65]	here, Cassio,
[05:29.93]	Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?
[05:33.72]CASSIO	None in the world; nor do I know the man.
[05:37.00]IAGO	[To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
[05:40.28]	o' the air.
[05:41.43]	[CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off]
[05:42.28]	Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
[05:46.06]	Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
[05:49.35]	Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
[05:52.70]	Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
[05:56.06]	Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
[05:59.84]	Though tongues were out of use.
[06:02.48]	[Enter EMILIA]
[06:03.34]EMILIA	'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?
[06:07.19]IAGO	Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
[06:10.54]	By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
[06:13.83]	He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
[06:16.82]EMILIA	Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
[06:19.89]IAGO	This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
[06:23.46]	Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
[06:26.96]	[To BIANCA]
[06:27.81]	What, do you shake at that?
[06:30.10]BIANCA	He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
[06:33.95]IAGO	O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
[06:36.95]EMILIA	Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
[06:39.31]BIANCA	I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
[06:42.52]	As you that thus abuse me.
[06:44.80]EMILIA	As I! foh! fie upon thee!
[06:46.87]IAGO	Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
[06:50.72]	Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
[06:54.22]	Emilia run you to the citadel,
[06:56.79]	And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
[07:00.29]	Will you go on? I pray.
[07:02.29]	[Aside]
[07:03.14]	This is the night
[07:04.86]	That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
[07:08.21]	[Exeunt]
