[00:00.40]	[Cyprus. Before the castle.,]
[00:01.21]	[Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]
[00:02.02]IAGO	Will you think so?
[00:03.65]OTHELLO	Think so, Iago!
[00:05.00]IAGO	What,
[00:05.75]	To kiss in private?
[00:07.44]OTHELLO	An unauthorized kiss.
[00:09.27]IAGO	Or to be naked with her friend in bed
[00:12.24]	An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
[00:15.15]OTHELLO	Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
[00:17.99]	It is hypocrisy against the devil:
[00:20.70]	They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
[00:23.81]	The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
[00:27.74]IAGO	So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
[00:30.65]	But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--
[00:33.56]OTHELLO	What then?
[00:34.64]IAGO	Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
[00:37.82]	She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
[00:40.66]OTHELLO	She is protectress of her honour too:
[00:43.57]	May she give that?
[00:45.20]IAGO	Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
[00:48.38]	They have it very oft that have it not:
[00:51.42]	But, for the handkerchief,--
[00:53.52]OTHELLO	By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
[00:56.97]	Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
[00:59.88]	As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
[01:03.13]	Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.
[01:06.04]IAGO	Ay, what of that?
[01:07.53]OTHELLO	That's not so good now.
[01:09.49]IAGO	What,
[01:10.23]	If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
[01:13.48]	Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,
[01:16.73]	Who having, by their own importunate suit,
[01:19.91]	Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
[01:22.82]	Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
[01:26.00]	But they must blab--
[01:27.69]OTHELLO	Hath he said any thing?
[01:29.65]IAGO	He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
[01:32.76]	No more than he'll unswear.
[01:35.00]OTHELLO	What hath he said?
[01:36.62]IAGO	'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.
[01:39.80]OTHELLO	What? what?
[01:40.88]IAGO	Lie--
[01:41.56]OTHELLO	With her?
[01:42.58]IAGO	With her, on her; what you will.
[01:45.01]OTHELLO	Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
[01:48.60]	they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
[01:51.91]	--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
[01:55.09]	confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be
[01:58.82]	hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.
[02:02.13]	Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
[02:05.92]	passion without some instruction. It is not words
[02:09.64]	that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
[02:13.03]	--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--
[02:16.34]	[Falls in a trance]
[02:17.15]IAGO	Work on,
[02:18.10]	My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
[02:21.82]	And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
[02:25.14]	All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
[02:28.52]	My lord, I say! Othello!
[02:30.42]	[Enter CASSIO]
[02:31.23]	How now, Cassio!
[02:32.65]CASSIO	What's the matter?
[02:34.27]IAGO	My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
[02:37.05]	This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
[02:40.43]CASSIO	Rub him about the temples.
[02:42.60]IAGO	No, forbear;
[02:43.75]	The lethargy must have his quiet course:
[02:46.86]	If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
[02:49.90]	Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
[02:53.22]	Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
[02:56.33]	He will recover straight: when he is gone,
[02:59.51]	I would on great occasion speak with you.
[03:02.69]	[Exit CASSIO]
[03:03.50]	How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?
[03:07.02]OTHELLO	Dost thou mock me?
[03:08.65]IAGO	I mock you! no, by heaven.
[03:10.68]	Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
[03:14.13]OTHELLO	A horned man's a monster and a beast.
[03:17.04]IAGO	There's many a beast then in a populous city,
[03:20.49]	And many a civil monster.
[03:22.59]OTHELLO	Did he confess it?
[03:24.21]IAGO	Good sir, be a man;
[03:25.83]	Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
[03:29.22]	May draw with you: there's millions now alive
[03:32.67]	That nightly lie in those unproper beds
[03:35.78]	Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
[03:39.64]	O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
[03:43.16]	To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
[03:45.86]	And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
[03:49.04]	And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
[03:52.63]OTHELLO	O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
[03:54.93]IAGO	Stand you awhile apart;
[03:56.89]	Confine yourself but in a patient list.
[03:59.94]	Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
[04:03.66]	A passion most unsuiting such a man--
[04:06.50]	Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
[04:09.48]	And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
[04:12.46]	Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
[04:15.84]	The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
[04:19.29]	And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
[04:23.01]	That dwell in every region of his face;
[04:26.06]	For I will make him tell the tale anew,
[04:29.10]	Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
[04:32.21]	He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
[04:35.26]	I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
[04:38.51]	Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
[04:41.89]	And nothing of a man.
[04:43.72]OTHELLO	Dost thou hear, Iago?
[04:45.48]	I will be found most cunning in my patience;
[04:48.86]	But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.
[04:51.36]IAGO	That's not amiss;
[04:52.92]	But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
[04:56.24]	[OTHELLO retires]
[04:57.05]	Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
[04:59.96]	A housewife that by selling her desires
[05:03.07]	Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
[05:06.72]	That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
[05:10.51]	To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
[05:13.56]	He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
[05:16.60]	From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
[05:19.85]	[Re-enter CASSIO]
[05:20.66]	As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
[05:23.71]	And his unbookish jealousy must construe
[05:26.89]	Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
[05:30.61]	Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?
[05:34.06]CASSIO	The worser that you give me the addition
[05:37.24]	Whose want even kills me.
[05:39.34]IAGO	Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
[05:42.52]	[Speaking lower]
[05:43.33]	Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
[05:46.38]	How quickly should you speed!
[05:48.74]CASSIO	Alas, poor caitiff!
[05:50.37]OTHELLO	Look, how he laughs already!
[05:52.60]IAGO	I never knew woman love man so.
[05:55.10]CASSIO	Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.
[05:58.56]OTHELLO	Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.
[06:01.87]IAGO	Do you hear, Cassio?
[06:03.56]OTHELLO	Now he importunes him
[06:05.46]	To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.
[06:08.70]IAGO	She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
[06:11.95]	Do you intend it?
[06:13.51]CASSIO	Ha, ha, ha!
[06:14.52]OTHELLO	Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?
[06:17.37]CASSIO	I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
[06:20.88]	charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
[06:24.61]	Ha, ha, ha!
[06:25.62]OTHELLO	So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.
[06:28.19]IAGO	'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
[06:31.58]CASSIO	Prithee, say true.
[06:33.13]IAGO	I am a very villain else.
[06:35.23]OTHELLO	Have you scored me? Well.
[06:37.26]CASSIO	This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
[06:40.58]	persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
[06:44.43]	flattery, not out of my promise.
[06:46.94]OTHELLO	Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
[06:50.05]CASSIO	She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
[06:53.91]	I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
[06:57.63]	certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
[07:01.21]	and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--
[07:04.94]OTHELLO	Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
[07:08.32]	imports it.
[07:09.47]CASSIO	So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
[07:12.99]	and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!
[07:14.88]OTHELLO	Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
[07:18.60]	I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
[07:22.39]	throw it to.
[07:23.61]CASSIO	Well, I must leave her company.
[07:26.05]IAGO	Before me! look, where she comes.
[07:28.55]CASSIO	'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
[07:32.07]	[Enter BIANCA]
[07:32.88]	What do you mean by this haunting of me?
[07:35.99]BIANCA	Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
[07:39.72]	mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
[07:43.64]	I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
[07:47.36]	work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find
[07:51.08]	it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
[07:54.87]	This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
[07:58.66]	work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
[08:02.32]	you had it, I'll take out no work on't.
[08:05.29]CASSIO	How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
[08:08.41]OTHELLO	By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
[08:11.59]BIANCA	An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
[08:15.31]	will not, come when you are next prepared for.
[08:18.76]	[Exit]
[08:19.57]IAGO	After her, after her.
[08:21.33]CASSIO	'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.
[08:24.71]IAGO	Will you sup there?
[08:26.40]CASSIO	'Faith, I intend so.
[08:28.03]IAGO	Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
[08:31.89]	speak with you.
[08:33.31]CASSIO	Prithee, come; will you?
[08:35.20]IAGO	Go to; say no more.
[08:36.82]	[Exit CASSIO]
[08:37.64]OTHELLO	[Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago?
[08:40.34]IAGO	Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
[08:43.73]OTHELLO	O Iago!
[08:44.61]IAGO	And did you see the handkerchief?
[08:47.25]OTHELLO	Was that mine?
[08:48.60]IAGO	Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
[08:52.25]	foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
[08:55.84]	hath given it his whore.
[08:57.87]OTHELLO	I would have him nine years a-killing.
[09:00.85]	A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!
[09:03.96]IAGO	Nay, you must forget that.
[09:06.06]OTHELLO	Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
[09:09.78]	for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
[09:13.43]	stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
[09:16.88]	world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
[09:20.74]	an emperor's side and command him tasks.
[09:23.85]IAGO	Nay, that's not your way.
[09:25.88]OTHELLO	Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
[09:29.40]	with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
[09:32.78]	will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
[09:36.57]	and plenteous wit and invention:--
[09:39.15]IAGO	She's the worse for all this.
[09:41.51]OTHELLO	O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
[09:44.83]	gentle a condition!
[09:46.52]IAGO	Ay, too gentle.
[09:47.87]OTHELLO	Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
[09:51.46]	O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
[09:53.69]IAGO	If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
[09:57.21]	patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
[10:01.00]	near nobody.
[10:02.22]OTHELLO	I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!
[10:05.26]IAGO	O, 'tis foul in her.
[10:06.89]OTHELLO	With mine officer!
[10:08.51]IAGO	That's fouler.
[10:09.87]OTHELLO	Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not
[10:13.25]	expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
[10:16.77]	unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.
[10:19.88]IAGO	Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
[10:23.74]	the bed she hath contaminated.
[10:26.17]OTHELLO	Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.
[10:29.69]IAGO	And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
[10:33.07]	shall hear more by midnight.
[10:35.38]OTHELLO	Excellent good.
[10:36.80]	[A trumpet within]
[10:37.61]	What trumpet is that same?
[10:39.77]IAGO	Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
[10:42.89]	Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.
[10:46.61]	[Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]
[10:47.42]LODOVICO	Save you, worthy general!
[10:49.45]OTHELLO	With all my heart, sir.
[10:51.34]LODOVICO	The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
[10:54.59]	[Gives him a letter]
[10:55.40]OTHELLO	I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
[10:58.58]	[Opens the letter, and reads]
[10:59.40]DESDEMONA	And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
[11:02.58]IAGO	I am very glad to see you, signior
[11:05.28]	Welcome to Cyprus.
[11:06.91]LODOVICO	I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
[11:09.95]IAGO	Lives, sir.
[11:11.03]DESDEMONA	Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
[11:14.55]	An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.
[11:18.00]OTHELLO	Are you sure of that?
[11:19.83]DESDEMONA	My lord?
[11:20.78]OTHELLO	[Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will--'
[11:24.03]LODOVICO	He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
[11:27.07]	Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
[11:30.39]DESDEMONA	A most unhappy one: I would do much
[11:33.16]	To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
[11:36.54]OTHELLO	Fire and brimstone!
[11:38.24]DESDEMONA	My lord?
[11:39.18]OTHELLO	Are you wise?
[11:40.47]DESDEMONA	What, is he angry?
[11:42.03]LODOVICO	May be the letter moved him;
[11:44.33]	For, as I think, they do command him home,
[11:47.44]	Deputing Cassio in his government.
[11:50.15]DESDEMONA	Trust me, I am glad on't.
[11:52.18]OTHELLO	Indeed!
[11:53.06]DESDEMONA	My lord?
[11:54.00]OTHELLO	I am glad to see you mad.
[11:56.10]DESDEMONA	Why, sweet Othello,--
[11:57.72]OTHELLO	[Striking her] Devil!
[11:58.94]DESDEMONA	I have not deserved this.
[12:01.04]LODOVICO	My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
[12:04.49]	Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
[12:07.87]	Make her amends; she weeps.
[12:10.04]OTHELLO	O devil, devil!
[12:11.39]	If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
[12:15.05]	Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
[12:18.43]	Out of my sight!
[12:19.92]DESDEMONA	I will not stay to offend you.
[12:22.35]	[Going]
[12:23.17]LODOVICO	Truly, an obedient lady:
[12:25.13]	I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
[12:28.31]OTHELLO	Mistress!
[12:29.32]DESDEMONA	My lord?
[12:30.27]OTHELLO	What would you with her, sir?
[12:32.57]LODOVICO	Who, I, my lord?
[12:33.93]OTHELLO	Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
[12:37.24]	Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
[12:40.35]	And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
[12:43.53]	And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
[12:46.58]	Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
[12:49.69]	Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--
[12:53.01]	I am commanded home. Get you away;
[12:55.65]	I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
[12:59.16]	And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
[13:02.21]	[Exit DESDEMONA]
[13:03.02]	Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
[13:06.34]	I do entreat that we may sup together:
[13:09.31]	You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!
[13:12.97]	[Exit]
[13:13.78]LODOVICO	Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
[13:17.16]	Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
[13:20.68]	Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
[13:24.34]	The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
[13:27.45]	Could neither graze nor pierce?
[13:29.95]IAGO	He is much changed.
[13:31.64]LODOVICO	Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?
[13:34.96]IAGO	He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
[13:38.41]	What he might be: if what he might he is not,
[13:41.79]	I would to heaven he were!
[13:43.96]LODOVICO	What, strike his wife!
[13:45.79]IAGO	'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
[13:49.17]	That stroke would prove the worst!
[13:51.88]LODOVICO	Is it his use?
[13:53.23]	Or did the letters work upon his blood,
[13:56.27]	And new-create this fault?
[13:58.44]IAGO	Alas, alas!
[13:59.52]	It is not honesty in me to speak
[14:02.16]	What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
[14:05.88]	And his own courses will denote him so
[14:08.93]	That I may save my speech: do but go after,
[14:12.18]	And mark how he continues.
[14:14.34]LODOVICO	I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
[14:17.25]	[Exeunt]
