[00:00.42]	[The garden of the castle.,]
[00:01.28]	[Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA]
[00:02.14]DESDEMONA	Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
[00:05.28]	All my abilities in thy behalf.
[00:07.93]EMILIA	Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
[00:11.64]	As if the case were his.
[00:13.79]DESDEMONA	O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
[00:17.50]	But I will have my lord and you again
[00:20.65]	As friendly as you were.
[00:22.79]CASSIO	Bounteous madam,
[00:24.36]	Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
[00:27.65]	He's never any thing but your true servant.
[00:31.15]DESDEMONA	I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
[00:34.51]	You have known him long; and be you well assured
[00:38.37]	He shall in strangeness stand no further off
[00:42.02]	Than in a polite distance.
[00:44.30]CASSIO	Ay, but, lady,
[00:45.59]	That policy may either last so long,
[00:48.59]	Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
[00:51.95]	Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
[00:55.16]	That, I being absent and my place supplied,
[00:58.59]	My general will forget my love and service.
[01:02.10]DESDEMONA	Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
[01:05.17]	I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
[01:08.81]	If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
[01:12.17]	To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
[01:15.82]	I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
[01:19.75]	His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
[01:23.54]	I'll intermingle every thing he does
[01:26.61]	With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
[01:30.25]	For thy solicitor shall rather die
[01:33.18]	Than give thy cause away.
[01:35.40]EMILIA	Madam, here comes my lord.
[01:37.61]CASSIO	Madam, I'll take my leave.
[01:39.83]DESDEMONA	Why, stay, and hear me speak.
[01:42.19]CASSIO	Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
[01:45.19]	Unfit for mine own purposes.
[01:47.62]DESDEMONA	Well, do your discretion.
[01:49.76]	[Exit CASSIO]
[01:50.62]	[Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]
[01:51.48]IAGO	Ha! I like not that.
[01:53.26]OTHELLO	What dost thou say?
[01:55.05]IAGO	Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
[01:58.20]OTHELLO	Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
[02:01.48]IAGO	Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
[02:04.84]	That he would steal away so guilty-like,
[02:08.13]	Seeing you coming.
[02:09.84]OTHELLO	I do believe 'twas he.
[02:11.77]DESDEMONA	How now, my lord!
[02:13.35]	I have been talking with a suitor here,
[02:16.56]	A man that languishes in your displeasure.
[02:19.99]OTHELLO	Who is't you mean?
[02:21.71]DESDEMONA	Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
[02:24.99]	If I have any grace or power to move you,
[02:28.35]	His present reconciliation take;
[02:31.07]	For if he be not one that truly loves you,
[02:34.50]	That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
[02:37.93]	I have no judgment in an honest face:
[02:41.00]	I prithee, call him back.
[02:43.15]OTHELLO	Went he hence now?
[02:44.86]DESDEMONA	Ay, sooth; so humbled
[02:46.72]	That he hath left part of his grief with me,
[02:50.29]	To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
[02:53.79]OTHELLO	Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
[02:57.08]DESDEMONA	But shall't be shortly?
[02:59.15]OTHELLO	The sooner, sweet, for you.
[03:01.37]DESDEMONA	Shall't be to-night at supper?
[03:03.94]OTHELLO	No, not to-night.
[03:05.51]DESDEMONA	To-morrow dinner, then?
[03:07.51]OTHELLO	I shall not dine at home;
[03:09.73]	I meet the captains at the citadel.
[03:12.66]DESDEMONA	Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
[03:16.02]	On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
[03:19.52]	I prithee, name the time, but let it not
[03:22.74]	Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
[03:26.09]	And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
[03:29.53]	Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
[03:33.31]	Out of their best--is not almost a fault
[03:36.60]	To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
[03:40.24]	Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
[03:43.25]	What you would ask me, that I should deny,
[03:46.60]	Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
[03:50.25]	That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
[03:54.04]	When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
[03:57.25]	Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
[04:00.75]	To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--
[04:04.11]OTHELLO	Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
[04:07.54]	I will deny thee nothing.
[04:09.76]DESDEMONA	Why, this is not a boon;
[04:11.83]	'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
[04:15.48]	Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
[04:19.19]	Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
[04:22.34]	To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
[04:25.77]	Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
[04:29.13]	It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
[04:32.91]	And fearful to be granted.
[04:35.20]OTHELLO	I will deny thee nothing:
[04:37.42]	Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
[04:40.70]	To leave me but a little to myself.
[04:43.63]DESDEMONA	Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
[04:46.71]OTHELLO	Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.
[04:50.64]DESDEMONA	Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
[04:53.99]	Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
[04:56.57]	[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
[04:57.42]OTHELLO	Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
[05:00.78]	But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
[05:04.36]	Chaos is come again.
[05:06.21]IAGO	My noble lord--
[05:07.64]OTHELLO	What dost thou say, Iago?
[05:09.79]IAGO	Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
[05:13.22]	Know of your love?
[05:14.93]OTHELLO	He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
[05:18.51]IAGO	But for a satisfaction of my thought;
[05:21.58]	No further harm.
[05:23.15]OTHELLO	Why of thy thought, Iago?
[05:25.30]IAGO	I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
[05:29.15]OTHELLO	O, yes; and went between us very oft.
[05:32.08]IAGO	Indeed!
[05:33.01]OTHELLO	Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
[05:36.80]	Is he not honest?
[05:38.44]IAGO	Honest, my lord!
[05:39.95]OTHELLO	Honest! ay, honest.
[05:41.59]IAGO	My lord, for aught I know.
[05:43.80]OTHELLO	What dost thou think?
[05:45.73]IAGO	Think, my lord!
[05:47.16]OTHELLO	Think, my lord!
[05:48.59]	By heaven, he echoes me,
[05:50.66]	As if there were some monster in his thought
[05:54.31]	Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
[05:58.24]	I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
[06:02.10]	When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
[06:05.74]	And when I told thee he was of my counsel
[06:09.17]	In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
[06:13.10]	And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
[06:16.89]	As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
[06:20.39]	Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
[06:23.90]	Show me thy thought.
[06:25.75]IAGO	My lord, you know I love you.
[06:28.18]OTHELLO	I think thou dost;
[06:29.90]	And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
[06:33.76]	And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
[06:38.04]	Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
[06:42.05]	For such things in a false disloyal knave
[06:45.48]	Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
[06:49.19]	They are close delations, working from the heart
[06:53.05]	That passion cannot rule.
[06:55.27]IAGO	For Michael Cassio,
[06:57.05]	I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
[07:00.48]OTHELLO	I think so too.
[07:01.99]IAGO	Men should be what they seem;
[07:04.49]	Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
[07:08.35]OTHELLO	Certain, men should be what they seem.
[07:11.42]IAGO	Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.
[07:14.71]OTHELLO	Nay, yet there's more in this:
[07:17.21]	I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
[07:20.64]	As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
[07:24.85]	The worst of words.
[07:26.64]IAGO	Good my lord, pardon me:
[07:28.71]	Though I am bound to every act of duty,
[07:31.93]	I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
[07:35.64]	Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
[07:39.65]	As where's that palace whereinto foul things
[07:43.29]	Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
[07:47.08]	But some uncleanly apprehensions
[07:49.87]	Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
[07:53.37]	With meditations lawful?
[07:55.51]OTHELLO	Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
[07:59.01]	If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
[08:03.16]	A stranger to thy thoughts.
[08:05.52]IAGO	I do beseech you--
[08:07.16]	Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
[08:10.59]	As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
[08:13.73]	To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
[08:16.95]	Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
[08:20.81]	From one that so imperfectly conceits,
[08:23.95]	Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
[08:27.96]	Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
[08:31.53]	It were not for your quiet nor your good,
[08:34.89]	Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
[08:37.96]	To let you know my thoughts.
[08:40.39]OTHELLO	What dost thou mean?
[08:42.25]IAGO	Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
[08:45.54]	Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
[08:48.68]	Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
[08:53.04]	'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
[08:57.04]	But he that filches from me my good name
[09:00.40]	Robs me of that which not enriches him
[09:03.62]	And makes me poor indeed.
[09:05.83]OTHELLO	By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
[09:08.62]IAGO	You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
[09:11.98]	Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
[09:15.19]OTHELLO	Ha!
[09:15.84]IAGO	O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
[09:18.34]	It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
[09:21.98]	The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
[09:25.91]	Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
[09:29.63]	But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
[09:32.92]	Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
[09:36.85]OTHELLO	O misery!
[09:37.92]IAGO	Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
[09:41.28]	But riches fineless is as poor as winter
[09:44.64]	To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
[09:47.92]	Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
[09:51.57]	From jealousy!
[09:53.00]OTHELLO	Why, why is this?
[09:54.57]	Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
[09:58.00]	To follow still the changes of the moon
[10:01.29]	With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
[10:04.93]	Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
[10:08.65]	When I shall turn the business of my soul
[10:12.08]	To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
[10:15.36]	Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
[10:19.37]	To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
[10:23.23]	Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
[10:26.94]	Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
[10:30.23]	Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
[10:33.66]	The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
[10:37.02]	For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
[10:40.16]	I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
[10:43.66]	And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
[10:47.17]	Away at once with love or jealousy!
[10:50.10]IAGO	I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
[10:53.67]	To show the love and duty that I bear you
[10:57.10]	With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
[11:00.67]	Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
[11:04.25]	Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
[11:08.03]	Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
[11:11.46]	I would not have your free and noble nature,
[11:15.04]	Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
[11:18.25]	I know our country disposition well;
[11:21.25]	In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
[11:24.83]	They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
[11:29.26]	Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
[11:32.83]OTHELLO	Dost thou say so?
[11:34.47]IAGO	She did deceive her father, marrying you;
[11:37.76]	And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
[11:41.69]	She loved them most.
[11:43.55]OTHELLO	And so she did.
[11:45.05]IAGO	Why, go to then;
[11:46.55]	She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
[11:50.41]	To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
[11:53.84]	He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
[11:57.84]	I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
[12:01.06]	For too much loving you.
[12:03.20]OTHELLO	I am bound to thee for ever.
[12:05.63]IAGO	I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
[12:09.28]OTHELLO	Not a jot, not a jot.
[12:11.13]IAGO	I' faith, I fear it has.
[12:13.14]	I hope you will consider what is spoke
[12:16.35]	Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
[12:20.00]	I am to pray you not to strain my speech
[12:23.36]	To grosser issues nor to larger reach
[12:26.50]	Than to suspicion.
[12:28.21]OTHELLO	I will not.
[12:29.43]IAGO	Should you do so, my lord,
[12:31.64]	My speech should fall into such vile success
[12:35.29]	As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
[12:39.43]	My lord, I see you're moved.
[12:41.79]OTHELLO	No, not much moved:
[12:43.51]	I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
[12:46.65]IAGO	Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
[12:50.44]OTHELLO	And yet, how nature erring from itself,--
[12:53.58]IAGO	Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
[12:57.16]	Not to affect many proposed matches
[13:00.16]	Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
[13:03.37]	Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
[13:06.80]	Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
[13:10.31]	Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
[13:13.45]	But pardon me; I do not in position
[13:16.38]	Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
[13:19.81]	Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
[13:23.24]	May fall to match you with her country forms
[13:26.89]	And happily repent.
[13:28.67]OTHELLO	Farewell, farewell:
[13:30.39]	If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
[13:33.96]	Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:
[13:37.32]IAGO	[Going] My lord, I take my leave.
[13:39.89]OTHELLO	Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
[13:43.68]	Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
[13:47.40]IAGO	[Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat
[13:50.54]	your honour
[13:51.83]	To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
[13:55.61]	Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
[13:59.19]	For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
[14:02.69]	Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
[14:06.05]	You shall by that perceive him and his means:
[14:09.69]	Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
[14:13.19]	With any strong or vehement importunity;
[14:16.48]	Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
[14:19.98]	Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
[14:23.20]	As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
[14:26.20]	And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
[14:29.70]OTHELLO	Fear not my government.
[14:31.77]IAGO	I once more take my leave.
[14:34.06]	[Exit]
[14:34.92]OTHELLO	This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
[14:37.85]	And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
[14:41.56]	Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
[14:45.14]	Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
[14:49.07]	I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
[14:52.86]	To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
[14:56.14]	And have not those soft parts of conversation
[14:59.86]	That chamberers have, or for I am declined
[15:03.29]	Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--
[15:06.79]	She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
[15:09.86]	Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
[15:13.29]	That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
[15:17.08]	And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
[15:20.87]	And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
[15:24.01]	Than keep a corner in the thing I love
[15:27.23]	For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
[15:31.16]	Prerogatived are they less than the base;
[15:34.52]	'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
[15:37.45]	Even then this forked plague is fated to us
[15:41.02]	When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
[15:43.95]	[Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
[15:44.81]	If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
[15:48.31]	I'll not believe't.
[15:50.10]DESDEMONA	How now, my dear Othello!
[15:52.24]	Your dinner, and the generous islanders
[15:55.46]	By you invited, do attend your presence.
[15:58.67]OTHELLO	I am to blame.
[16:00.10]DESDEMONA	Why do you speak so faintly?
[16:02.53]	Are you not well?
[16:04.18]OTHELLO	I have a pain upon my forehead here.
[16:07.18]DESDEMONA	'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
[16:10.75]	Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
[16:14.11]	It will be well.
[16:15.68]OTHELLO	Your napkin is too little:
[16:17.97]	[He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops]
[16:18.83]	Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.
[16:21.97]DESDEMONA	I am very sorry that you are not well.
[16:25.12]	[Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]
[16:25.97]EMILIA	I am glad I have found this napkin:
[16:28.90]	This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
[16:32.55]	My wayward husband hath a hundred times
[16:35.83]	Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
[16:39.69]	For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
[16:43.27]	That she reserves it evermore about her
[16:46.55]	To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
[16:50.48]	And give't Iago: what he will do with it
[16:53.77]	Heaven knows, not I;
[16:55.56]	I nothing but to please his fantasy.
[16:58.56]	[Re-enter Iago]
[16:59.42]IAGO	How now! what do you here alone?
[17:02.06]EMILIA	Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
[17:05.35]IAGO	A thing for me? it is a common thing--
[17:08.35]EMILIA	Ha!
[17:08.99]IAGO	To have a foolish wife.
[17:11.07]EMILIA	O, is that all? What will you give me now
[17:14.35]	For the same handkerchief?
[17:16.64]IAGO	What handkerchief?
[17:18.36]EMILIA	What handkerchief?
[17:20.07]	Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
[17:23.50]	That which so often you did bid me steal.
[17:26.86]IAGO	Hast stol'n it from her?
[17:29.00]EMILIA	No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
[17:32.22]	And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
[17:35.79]	Look, here it is.
[17:37.36]IAGO	A good wench; give it me.
[17:39.51]EMILIA	What will you do with 't, that you have been
[17:43.01]	so earnest
[17:44.22]	To have me filch it?
[17:46.08]IAGO	[Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?
[17:48.58]EMILIA	If it be not for some purpose of import,
[17:51.87]	Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
[17:55.23]	When she shall lack it.
[17:57.30]IAGO	Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
[18:00.45]	Go, leave me.
[18:01.73]	[Exit EMILIA]
[18:02.59]	I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
[18:06.16]	And let him find it. Trifles light as air
[18:09.52]	Are to the jealous confirmations strong
[18:12.81]	As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
[18:16.45]	The Moor already changes with my poison:
[18:19.74]	Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
[18:23.60]	Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
[18:27.46]	But with a little act upon the blood.
[18:30.53]	Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
[18:34.11]	Look, where he comes!
[18:35.96]	[Re-enter OTHELLO]
[18:36.82]	Not poppy, nor mandragora,
[18:39.04]	Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
[18:42.25]	Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
[18:45.90]	Which thou owedst yesterday.
[18:48.33]OTHELLO	Ha! ha! false to me?
[18:50.04]IAGO	Why, how now, general! no more of that.
[18:53.04]OTHELLO	Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
[18:56.62]	I swear 'tis better to be much abused
[18:59.69]	Than but to know't a little.
[19:02.12]IAGO	How now, my lord!
[19:03.69]OTHELLO	What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
[19:07.34]	I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
[19:10.91]	I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
[19:14.70]	I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
[19:17.98]	He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
[19:21.63]	Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.
[19:25.35]IAGO	I am sorry to hear this.
[19:27.49]OTHELLO	I had been happy, if the general camp,
[19:30.56]	Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
[19:33.99]	So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
[19:37.14]	Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
[19:40.71]	Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
[19:44.21]	That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
[19:47.28]	Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
[19:51.21]	The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
[19:55.00]	The royal banner, and all quality,
[19:57.79]	Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
[20:01.36]	And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
[20:04.94]	The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
[20:08.65]	Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
[20:11.72]IAGO	Is't possible, my lord?
[20:13.73]OTHELLO	Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
[20:17.23]	Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
[20:20.44]	Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
[20:23.59]	Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
[20:27.16]	Than answer my waked wrath!
[20:29.52]IAGO	Is't come to this?
[20:31.23]OTHELLO	Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
[20:34.88]	That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
[20:38.31]	To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
[20:41.60]IAGO	My noble lord,--
[20:43.03]OTHELLO	If thou dost slander her and torture me,
[20:46.31]	Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
[20:49.31]	On horror's head horrors accumulate;
[20:52.32]	Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
[20:56.03]	For nothing canst thou to damnation add
[20:59.32]	Greater than that.
[21:01.03]IAGO	O grace! O heaven forgive me!
[21:03.46]	Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
[21:06.68]	God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
[21:10.47]	That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
[21:13.83]	O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
[21:17.54]	To be direct and honest is not safe.
[21:20.54]	I thank you for this profit; and from hence
[21:24.05]	I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
[21:28.05]OTHELLO	Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.
[21:30.83]IAGO	I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
[21:33.98]	And loses that it works for.
[21:36.41]OTHELLO	By the world,
[21:37.77]	I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
[21:41.55]	I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
[21:45.56]	I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
[21:49.42]	As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
[21:52.92]	As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
[21:56.56]	Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
[21:59.71]	I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
[22:03.14]IAGO	I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
[22:06.42]	I do repent me that I put it to you.
[22:09.42]	You would be satisfied?
[22:11.50]OTHELLO	Would! nay, I will.
[22:13.14]IAGO	And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
[22:16.29]	Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
[22:19.64]	Behold her topp'd?
[22:21.36]OTHELLO	Death and damnation! O!
[22:23.36]IAGO	It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
[22:26.43]	To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
[22:30.15]	If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
[22:33.44]	More than their own! What then? how then?
[22:36.65]	What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
[22:39.80]	It is impossible you should see this,
[22:42.87]	Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
[22:46.59]	As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
[22:50.30]	As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
[22:53.45]	If imputation and strong circumstances,
[22:56.66]	Which lead directly to the door of truth,
[23:00.02]	Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
[23:03.45]OTHELLO	Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
[23:06.67]IAGO	I do not like the office:
[23:08.88]	But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
[23:12.38]	Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
[23:15.74]	I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
[23:18.89]	And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
[23:22.10]	I could not sleep.
[23:23.82]	There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
[23:27.18]	That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
[23:30.96]	One of this kind is Cassio:
[23:33.32]	In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
[23:36.68]	Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
[23:39.75]	And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
[23:43.47]	Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
[23:46.97]	As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
[23:50.26]	That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
[23:53.62]	Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
[23:57.26]	Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'
[24:00.91]OTHELLO	O monstrous! monstrous!
[24:02.91]IAGO	Nay, this was but his dream.
[24:05.27]OTHELLO	But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
[24:08.48]	'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
[24:12.06]IAGO	And this may help to thicken other proofs
[24:15.49]	That do demonstrate thinly.
[24:17.84]OTHELLO	I'll tear her all to pieces.
[24:20.27]IAGO	Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
[24:23.56]	She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
[24:26.78]	Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
[24:30.28]	Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
[24:33.99]OTHELLO	I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
[24:37.35]IAGO	I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
[24:40.64]	I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
[24:44.07]	See Cassio wipe his beard with.
[24:46.72]OTHELLO	If it be that--
[24:48.14]IAGO	If it be that, or any that was hers,
[24:51.07]	It speaks against her with the other proofs.
[24:54.65]OTHELLO	O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
[24:58.08]	One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
[25:01.37]	Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
[25:04.44]	All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
[25:07.87]	'Tis gone.
[25:08.94]	Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
[25:12.44]	Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
[25:16.09]	To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
[25:19.87]	For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
[25:22.16]IAGO	Yet be content.
[25:23.66]OTHELLO	O, blood, blood, blood!
[25:25.52]IAGO	Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
[25:29.09]OTHELLO	Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
[25:31.95]	Whose icy current and compulsive course
[25:35.24]	Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
[25:38.67]	To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
[25:41.67]	Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
[25:45.31]	Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
[25:49.10]	Till that a capable and wide revenge
[25:52.18]	Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
[25:55.61]	[Kneels]
[25:56.46]	In the due reverence of a sacred vow
[25:59.54]	I here engage my words.
[26:01.61]IAGO	Do not rise yet.
[26:03.18]	[Kneels]
[26:04.04]	Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
[26:07.18]	You elements that clip us round about,
[26:10.33]	Witness that here Iago doth give up
[26:13.33]	The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
[26:16.40]	To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
[26:20.05]	And to obey shall be in me remorse,
[26:22.98]	What bloody business ever.
[26:25.26]	[They rise]
[26:26.12]OTHELLO	I greet thy love,
[26:27.76]	Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
[26:31.84]	And will upon the instant put thee to't:
[26:35.12]	Within these three days let me hear thee say
[26:38.77]	That Cassio's not alive.
[26:40.91]IAGO	My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
[26:44.42]	But let her live.
[26:46.06]OTHELLO	Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
[26:48.63]	Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
[26:51.78]	To furnish me with some swift means of death
[26:55.42]	For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
[26:59.14]IAGO	I am your own for ever.
[27:01.21]	[Exeunt]
