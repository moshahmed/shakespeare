[00:00.51]	[Re-enter RODERIGO]
[00:01.54]	How now, Roderigo!
[00:03.51]RODERIGO	I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
[00:08.48]	hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
[00:13.10]	almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
[00:17.99]	cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
[00:22.61]	have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
[00:27.32]	no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
[00:33.06]IAGO	How poor are they that have not patience!
[00:37.09]	What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
[00:41.03]	Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
[00:45.83]	And wit depends on dilatory time.
[00:49.17]	Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
[00:53.37]	And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
[00:58.17]	Though other things grow fair against the sun,
[01:02.62]	Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
[01:07.33]	Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
[01:11.87]	Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
[01:16.33]	Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
[01:20.18]	Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
[01:24.30]	Nay, get thee gone.
[01:26.35]	[Exit RODERIGO]
[01:27.38]	Two things are to be done:
[01:30.12]	My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
[01:34.49]	I'll set her on;
[01:36.37]	Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
[01:40.32]	And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
[01:44.51]	Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
[01:48.28]	Dull not device by coldness and delay.
[01:52.05]	[Exit]
