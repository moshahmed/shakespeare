[00:00.40]	[A council-chamber.,]
[00:01.21]	[The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers
[00:01.62]	+ attending]
[00:02.02]DUKE OF VENICE	There is no composition in these news
[00:05.00]	That gives them credit.
[00:06.96]First Senator	Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
[00:09.53]	My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
[00:12.84]DUKE OF VENICE	And mine, a hundred and forty.
[00:15.21]Second Senator	And mine, two hundred:
[00:17.04]	But though they jump not on a just account,--
[00:20.35]	As in these cases, where the aim reports,
[00:23.46]	'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
[00:27.11]	A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
[00:30.29]DUKE OF VENICE	Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
[00:33.27]	I do not so secure me in the error,
[00:36.04]	But the main article I do approve
[00:38.74]	In fearful sense.
[00:40.30]Sailor	[Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!
[00:42.73]First Officer	A messenger from the galleys.
[00:45.10]	[Enter a Sailor]
[00:45.91]DUKE OF VENICE	Now, what's the business?
[00:47.94]Sailor	The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
[00:51.12]	So was I bid report here to the state
[00:54.09]	By Signior Angelo.
[00:55.72]DUKE OF VENICE	How say you by this change?
[00:57.95]First Senator	This cannot be,
[00:59.37]	By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
[01:02.21]	To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
[01:05.45]	The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
[01:08.36]	And let ourselves again but understand,
[01:11.40]	That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
[01:14.92]	So may he with more facile question bear it,
[01:18.30]	For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
[01:21.75]	But altogether lacks the abilities
[01:24.52]	That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
[01:28.51]	We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
[01:31.83]	To leave that latest which concerns him first,
[01:35.34]	Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
[01:38.39]	To wake and wage a danger profitless.
[01:41.29]DUKE OF VENICE	Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
[01:44.54]First Officer	Here is more news.
[01:46.16]	[Enter a Messenger]
[01:46.97]Messenger	The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
[01:49.81]	Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
[01:53.74]	Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
[01:57.25]First Senator	Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
[02:00.23]Messenger	Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
[02:03.20]	Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
[02:07.13]	Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
[02:10.57]	Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
[02:13.55]	With his free duty recommends you thus,
[02:16.59]	And prays you to believe him.
[02:18.96]DUKE OF VENICE	'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
[02:21.26]	Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
[02:23.96]First Senator	He's now in Florence.
[02:25.79]DUKE OF VENICE	Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.
[02:29.31]First Senator	Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
[02:32.55]	[Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers]
[02:33.36]DUKE OF VENICE	Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
[02:36.74]	Against the general enemy Ottoman.
[02:39.45]	[To BRABANTIO]
[02:40.26]	I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
[02:43.44]	We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
[02:46.89]BRABANTIO	So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
[02:50.07]	Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
[02:53.65]	Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
[02:57.64]	Take hold on me, for my particular grief
[03:00.75]	Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
[03:04.06]	That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
[03:07.38]	And it is still itself.
[03:09.34]DUKE OF VENICE	Why, what's the matter?
[03:11.23]BRABANTIO	My daughter! O, my daughter!
[03:13.40]DUKE OF VENICE	|	Dead?
[03:14.14]Senator	|
[03:14.55]BRABANTIO	Ay, to me;
[03:15.56]	She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
[03:18.87]	By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
[03:22.39]	For nature so preposterously to err,
[03:25.23]	Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
[03:28.54]	Sans witchcraft could not.
[03:30.71]DUKE OF VENICE	Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
[03:34.02]	Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
[03:37.40]	And you of her, the bloody book of law
[03:40.38]	You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
[03:43.83]	After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
[03:47.41]	Stood in your action.
[03:49.24]BRABANTIO	Humbly I thank your grace.
[03:51.40]	Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
[03:54.78]	Your special mandate for the state-affairs
[03:58.10]	Hath hither brought.
[03:59.85]DUKE OF VENICE	|
[04:00.26]	| We are very sorry for't.
[04:02.29]Senator	|
[04:02.69]DUKE OF VENICE	[To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this?
[04:06.35]BRABANTIO	Nothing, but this is so.
[04:08.31]OTHELLO	Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
[04:11.42]	My very noble and approved good masters,
[04:14.53]	That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
[04:18.11]	It is most true; true, I have married her:
[04:21.22]	The very head and front of my offending
[04:24.33]	Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
[04:27.98]	And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
[04:31.70]	For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
[04:35.49]	Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
[04:39.07]	Their dearest action in the tented field,
[04:42.25]	And little of this great world can I speak,
[04:45.57]	More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
[04:49.22]	And therefore little shall I grace my cause
[04:52.60]	In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
[04:56.59]	I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
[04:59.70]	Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
[05:03.49]	What conjuration and what mighty magic,
[05:06.53]	For such proceeding I am charged withal,
[05:09.64]	I won his daughter.
[05:11.33]BRABANTIO	A maiden never bold;
[05:13.09]	Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
[05:16.54]	Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
[05:20.05]	Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
[05:23.10]	To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
[05:26.75]	It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
[05:30.06]	That will confess perfection so could err
[05:33.31]	Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
[05:36.89]	To find out practises of cunning hell,
[05:39.87]	Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
[05:43.18]	That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
[05:46.83]	Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
[05:50.08]	He wrought upon her.
[05:51.84]DUKE OF VENICE	To vouch this, is no proof,
[05:54.00]	Without more wider and more overt test
[05:57.04]	Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
[06:00.42]	Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
[06:03.54]First Senator	But, Othello, speak:
[06:05.16]	Did you by indirect and forced courses
[06:08.20]	Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
[06:11.79]	Or came it by request and such fair question
[06:15.23]	As soul to soul affordeth?
[06:17.40]OTHELLO	I do beseech you,
[06:18.95]	Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
[06:21.73]	And let her speak of me before her father:
[06:24.97]	If you do find me foul in her report,
[06:27.88]	The trust, the office I do hold of you,
[06:30.86]	Not only take away, but let your sentence
[06:34.03]	Even fall upon my life.
[06:35.99]DUKE OF VENICE	Fetch Desdemona hither.
[06:37.96]OTHELLO	Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.
[06:41.40]	[Exeunt IAGO and Attendants]
[06:42.22]	And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
[06:45.33]	I do confess the vices of my blood,
[06:48.10]	So justly to your grave ears I'll present
[06:51.34]	How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
[06:54.59]	And she in mine.
[06:56.08]DUKE OF VENICE	Say it, Othello.
[06:57.50]OTHELLO	Her father loved me; oft invited me;
[07:00.27]	Still question'd me the story of my life,
[07:03.45]	From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
[07:06.97]	That I have passed.
[07:08.66]	I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
[07:11.90]	To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
[07:15.22]	Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
[07:18.53]	Of moving accidents by flood and field
[07:21.57]	Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
[07:25.49]	Of being taken by the insolent foe
[07:28.27]	And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
[07:31.65]	And portance in my travels' history:
[07:34.42]	Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
[07:37.53]	Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
[07:41.72]	It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
[07:45.17]	And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
[07:48.35]	The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
[07:51.33]	Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
[07:54.77]	Would Desdemona seriously incline:
[07:57.48]	But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
[08:01.27]	Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
[08:04.65]	She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
[08:07.76]	Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
[08:10.94]	Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
[08:14.39]	To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
[08:17.70]	That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
[08:20.67]	Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
[08:23.99]	But not intentively: I did consent,
[08:26.69]	And often did beguile her of her tears,
[08:29.74]	When I did speak of some distressful stroke
[08:33.12]	That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
[08:36.43]	She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
[08:39.68]	She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
[08:43.67]	'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
[08:46.44]	She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
[08:50.02]	That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
[08:53.88]	And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
[08:57.33]	I should but teach him how to tell my story.
[09:00.71]	And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
[09:04.22]	She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
[09:07.47]	And I loved her that she did pity them.
[09:10.51]	This only is the witchcraft I have used:
[09:13.62]	Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
[09:16.67]	[Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants]
[09:17.48]DUKE OF VENICE	I think this tale would win my daughter too.
[09:20.86]	Good Brabantio,
[09:22.28]	Take up this mangled matter at the best:
[09:25.39]	Men do their broken weapons rather use
[09:28.43]	Than their bare hands.
[09:30.33]BRABANTIO	I pray you, hear her speak:
[09:32.49]	If she confess that she was half the wooer,
[09:35.80]	Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
[09:38.85]	Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
[09:42.30]	Do you perceive in all this noble company
[09:45.54]	Where most you owe obedience?
[09:47.91]DESDEMONA	My noble father,
[09:49.40]	I do perceive here a divided duty:
[09:52.10]	To you I am bound for life and education;
[09:55.28]	My life and education both do learn me
[09:58.32]	How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
[10:01.70]	I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
[10:05.49]	And so much duty as my mother show'd
[10:08.40]	To you, preferring you before her father,
[10:11.51]	So much I challenge that I may profess
[10:14.55]	Due to the Moor my lord.
[10:16.58]BRABANTIO	God be wi' you! I have done.
[10:18.74]	Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
[10:22.19]	I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
[10:25.44]	Come hither, Moor:
[10:26.99]	I here do give thee that with all my heart
[10:30.31]	Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
[10:33.82]	I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
[10:37.14]	I am glad at soul I have no other child:
[10:40.25]	For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
[10:43.22]	To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.
[10:46.47]DUKE OF VENICE	Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
[10:49.99]	Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
[10:53.57]	Into your favour.
[10:55.13]	When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
[10:58.51]	By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
[11:02.23]	To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
[11:05.47]	Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
[11:08.58]	What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
[11:11.96]	Patience her injury a mockery makes.
[11:14.80]	The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
[11:18.93]	He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
[11:22.38]BRABANTIO	So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
[11:25.28]	We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
[11:28.33]	He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
[11:31.84]	But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
[11:35.50]	But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
[11:39.01]	That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
[11:42.60]	These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
[11:45.44]	Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
[11:48.61]	But words are words; I never yet did hear
[11:51.79]	That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
[11:55.65]	I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
[11:59.64]DUKE OF VENICE	The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
[12:03.42]	Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
[12:07.21]	known to you; and though we have there a substitute
[12:11.07]	of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
[12:14.31]	sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
[12:18.10]	voice on you: you must therefore be content to
[12:21.61]	slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
[12:25.33]	more stubborn and boisterous expedition.
[12:28.44]OTHELLO	The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
[12:31.42]	Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
[12:34.80]	My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
[12:37.98]	A natural and prompt alacrity
[12:40.41]	I find in hardness, and do undertake
[12:43.25]	These present wars against the Ottomites.
[12:46.43]	Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
[12:49.81]	I crave fit disposition for my wife.
[12:52.65]	Due reference of place and exhibition,
[12:55.63]	With such accommodation and besort
[12:58.40]	As levels with her breeding.
[13:00.70]DUKE OF VENICE	If you please,
[13:02.05]	Be't at her father's.
[13:03.88]BRABANTIO	I'll not have it so.
[13:05.64]OTHELLO	Nor I.
[13:06.45]DESDEMONA	Nor I; I would not there reside,
[13:08.95]	To put my father in impatient thoughts
[13:11.99]	By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
[13:15.04]	To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
[13:18.22]	And let me find a charter in your voice,
[13:21.33]	To assist my simpleness.
[13:23.35]DUKE OF VENICE	What would You, Desdemona?
[13:25.45]DESDEMONA	That I did love the Moor to live with him,
[13:28.70]	My downright violence and storm of fortunes
[13:32.08]	May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
[13:35.46]	Even to the very quality of my lord:
[13:38.30]	I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
[13:41.07]	And to his honour and his valiant parts
[13:44.18]	Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
[13:47.16]	So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
[13:50.20]	A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
[13:53.11]	The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
[13:56.56]	And I a heavy interim shall support
[13:59.40]	By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
[14:02.44]OTHELLO	Let her have your voices.
[14:04.54]	Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
[14:07.92]	To please the palate of my appetite,
[14:10.76]	Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
[14:14.00]	In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
[14:16.98]	But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
[14:20.16]	And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
[14:23.88]	I will your serious and great business scant
[14:27.33]	For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
[14:30.77]	Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
[14:34.22]	My speculative and officed instruments,
[14:37.27]	That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
[14:40.85]	Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
[14:44.03]	And all indign and base adversities
[14:46.87]	Make head against my estimation!
[14:49.44]DUKE OF VENICE	Be it as you shall privately determine,
[14:52.48]	Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
[14:56.40]	And speed must answer it.
[14:58.50]First Senator	You must away to-night.
[15:00.46]OTHELLO	With all my heart.
[15:02.08]DUKE OF VENICE	At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
[15:05.46]	Othello, leave some officer behind,
[15:08.17]	And he shall our commission bring to you;
[15:11.35]	With such things else of quality and respect
[15:14.80]	As doth import you.
[15:16.49]OTHELLO	So please your grace, my ancient;
[15:19.06]	A man he is of honest and trust:
[15:21.63]	To his conveyance I assign my wife,
[15:24.40]	With what else needful your good grace shall think
[15:28.25]	To be sent after me.
[15:30.01]DUKE OF VENICE	Let it be so.
[15:31.30]	Good night to every one.
[15:33.33]	[To BRABANTIO]
[15:34.14]	And, noble signior,
[15:35.76]	If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
[15:38.53]	Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
[15:41.91]First Senator	Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
[15:44.75]BRABANTIO	Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
[15:48.00]	She has deceived her father, and may thee.
[15:51.18]	[Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, &c]
[15:51.99]OTHELLO	My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
[15:54.76]	My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
[15:57.47]	I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
[16:00.37]	And bring them after in the best advantage.
[16:03.69]	Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
[16:06.39]	Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
[16:09.57]	To spend with thee: we must obey the time.
[16:12.75]	[Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]
[16:13.56]RODERIGO	Iago,--
[16:14.30]IAGO	What say'st thou, noble heart?
[16:16.67]RODERIGO	What will I do, thinkest thou?
[16:19.04]IAGO	Why, go to bed, and sleep.
[16:21.07]RODERIGO	I will incontinently drown myself.
[16:23.77]IAGO	If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
[16:27.36]	thou silly gentleman!
[16:29.18]RODERIGO	It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
[16:33.10]	then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
[16:37.77]IAGO	O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
[16:41.62]	times seven years; and since I could distinguish
[16:45.28]	betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
[16:49.06]	that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
[16:52.71]	would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
[16:56.50]	would change my humanity with a baboon.
[16:59.54]RODERIGO	What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
[17:03.40]	fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
[17:06.78]IAGO	Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
[17:10.36]	or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
[17:14.02]	our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
[17:17.74]	nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
[17:21.25]	thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
[17:24.63]	distract it with many, either to have it sterile
[17:28.28]	with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
[17:31.87]	power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
[17:35.72]	wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
[17:39.24]	scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
[17:43.09]	blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
[17:46.95]	to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
[17:50.40]	reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
[17:53.85]	stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
[17:57.70]	you call love to be a sect or scion.
[18:00.54]RODERIGO	It cannot be.
[18:01.83]IAGO	It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
[18:05.82]	the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
[18:09.13]	cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
[18:12.71]	friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
[18:16.57]	cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
[18:20.02]	better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
[18:23.40]	purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
[18:27.18]	an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
[18:30.90]	cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
[18:34.69]	love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
[18:38.27]	his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
[18:42.06]	shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
[18:45.58]	money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
[18:49.30]	their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
[18:52.88]	that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
[18:56.74]	to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
[19:00.52]	change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
[19:04.24]	she will find the error of her choice: she must
[19:07.83]	have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
[19:11.48]	purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
[19:14.99]	more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
[19:18.85]	thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
[19:22.57]	an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
[19:26.42]	too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
[19:30.34]	shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
[19:33.86]	drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
[19:37.58]	thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
[19:41.50]	to be drowned and go without her.
[19:44.14]RODERIGO	Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
[19:47.59]	the issue?
[19:48.67]IAGO	Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
[19:52.19]	thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
[19:55.84]	hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
[19:59.49]	less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
[20:03.21]	against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
[20:06.86]	thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
[20:10.31]	events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
[20:14.16]	Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
[20:17.81]	of this to-morrow. Adieu.
[20:19.84]RODERIGO	Where shall we meet i' the morning?
[20:22.55]IAGO	At my lodging.
[20:23.90]RODERIGO	I'll be with thee betimes.
[20:26.06]IAGO	Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
[20:28.90]RODERIGO	What say you?
[20:30.19]IAGO	No more of drowning, do you hear?
[20:32.76]RODERIGO	I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.
[20:35.73]	[Exit]
[20:36.55]IAGO	Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
[20:39.45]	For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
[20:43.04]	If I would time expend with such a snipe.
[20:46.22]	But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
[20:49.60]	And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
[20:53.11]	He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
[20:56.63]	But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
[20:59.61]	Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
[21:02.85]	The better shall my purpose work on him.
[21:05.96]	Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
[21:08.87]	To get his place and to plume up my will
[21:12.05]	In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
[21:14.89]	After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
[21:17.93]	That he is too familiar with his wife.
[21:20.91]	He hath a person and a smooth dispose
[21:23.88]	To be suspected, framed to make women false.
[21:27.20]	The Moor is of a free and open nature,
[21:30.17]	That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
[21:33.69]	And will as tenderly be led by the nose
[21:36.80]	As asses are.
[21:38.08]	I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
[21:41.26]	Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
[21:45.25]	[Exit]
