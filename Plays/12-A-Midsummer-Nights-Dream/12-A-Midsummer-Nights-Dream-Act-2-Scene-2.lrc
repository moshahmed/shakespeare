[00:00.64]	[Another part of the wood.,]
[00:01.92]	[Enter TITANIA, with her train]
[00:03.20]TITANIA	Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
[00:07.69]	Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
[00:12.83]	Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
[00:18.07]	Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
[00:23.95]	To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
[00:29.72]	The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
[00:35.61]	At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
[00:40.63]	Then to your offices and let me rest.
[00:45.23]	[The Fairies sing]
[00:46.51]	You spotted snakes with double tongue,
[00:51.22]	Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
[00:54.96]	Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
[00:59.24]	Come not near our fairy queen.
[01:03.09]	Philomel, with melody
[01:05.98]	Sing in our sweet lullaby;
[01:09.40]	Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
[01:14.32]	Never harm,
[01:16.14]	Nor spell nor charm,
[01:18.92]	Come our lovely lady nigh;
[01:22.34]	So, good night, with lullaby.
[01:25.87]	Weaving spiders, come not here;
[01:29.72]	Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
[01:34.32]	Beetles black, approach not near;
[01:38.38]	Worm nor snail, do no offence.
[01:42.12]	Philomel, with melody, &c.
[01:45.23]Fairy	Hence, away! now all is well:
[01:48.75]	One aloof stand sentinel.
[01:52.07]	[Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps]
[01:53.35]	[Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids]
[01:54.64]OBERON	What thou seest when thou dost wake,
[01:59.13]	Do it for thy true-love take,
[02:02.87]	Love and languish for his sake:
[02:06.83]	Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
[02:10.36]	Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
[02:14.42]	In thy eye that shall appear
[02:18.16]	When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
[02:22.23]	Wake when some vile thing is near.
[02:26.51]	[Exit]
[02:27.79]	[Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA]
[02:29.07]LYSANDER	Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
[02:34.74]	And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
[02:39.77]	We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
[02:44.90]	And tarry for the comfort of the day.
[02:49.50]HERMIA	Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
[02:54.10]	For I upon this bank will rest my head.
[02:58.91]LYSANDER	One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
[03:04.15]	One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
[03:09.39]HERMIA	Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
[03:14.09]	Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
[03:18.91]LYSANDER	O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
[03:23.72]	Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
[03:29.07]	I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
[03:33.99]	So that but one heart we can make of it;
[03:38.90]	Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
[03:43.50]	So then two bosoms and a single troth.
[03:48.21]	Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
[03:52.91]	For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
[03:57.09]HERMIA	Lysander riddles very prettily:
[04:01.04]	Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
[04:06.07]	If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
[04:10.67]	But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
[04:15.59]	Lie further off; in human modesty,
[04:19.76]	Such separation as may well be said
[04:24.25]	Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
[04:29.06]	So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
[04:34.62]	Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
[04:40.08]LYSANDER	Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
[04:44.57]	And then end life when I end loyalty!
[04:49.17]	Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
[04:54.51]HERMIA	With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
[05:00.39]	[They sleep]
[05:01.68]	[Enter PUCK]
[05:02.96]PUCK	Through the forest have I gone.
[05:06.92]	But Athenian found I none,
[05:10.34]	On whose eyes I might approve
[05:14.19]	This flower's force in stirring love.
[05:18.79]	Night and silence.--Who is here?
[05:22.64]	Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
[05:26.38]	This is he, my master said,
[05:29.80]	Despised the Athenian maid;
[05:33.33]	And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
[05:37.72]	On the dank and dirty ground.
[05:41.46]	Pretty soul! she durst not lie
[05:45.31]	Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
[05:50.12]	Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
[05:53.76]	All the power this charm doth owe.
[05:58.04]	When thou wakest, let love forbid
[06:02.21]	Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
[06:05.95]	So awake when I am gone;
[06:09.16]	For I must now to Oberon.
[06:12.47]	[Exit]
[06:13.76]	[Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running]
[06:15.04]HELENA	Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
[06:20.07]DEMETRIUS	I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
[06:25.52]HELENA	O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
[06:30.44]DEMETRIUS	Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
[06:34.72]	[Exit]
[06:36.00]HELENA	O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
[06:40.92]	The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
[06:46.05]	Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
[06:50.65]	For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
[06:55.68]	How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
[07:01.45]	If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
[07:06.69]	No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
[07:10.44]	For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
[07:15.57]	Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
[07:20.17]	Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
[07:24.77]	What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
[07:29.90]	Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
[07:35.03]	But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
[07:39.84]	Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
[07:44.66]	Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
[07:49.15]LYSANDER	[Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
[07:55.46]	Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
[07:59.95]	That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
[08:05.51]	Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
[08:10.00]	Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
[08:14.92]HELENA	Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
[08:19.20]	What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
[08:25.08]	Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
[08:30.32]LYSANDER	Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
[08:34.71]	The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
[08:39.84]	Not Hermia but Helena I love:
[08:43.58]	Who will not change a raven for a dove?
[08:48.39]	The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
[08:53.31]	And reason says you are the worthier maid.
[08:58.45]	Things growing are not ripe until their season
[09:04.12]	So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
[09:09.57]	And touching now the point of human skill,
[09:14.70]	Reason becomes the marshal to my will
[09:19.41]	And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
[09:24.65]	Love's stories written in love's richest book.
[09:30.21]HELENA	Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
[09:35.34]	When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
[09:40.69]	Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
[09:45.82]	That I did never, no, nor never can,
[09:50.10]	Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
[09:55.02]	But you must flout my insufficiency?
[09:59.51]	Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
[10:04.96]	In such disdainful manner me to woo.
[10:09.46]	But fare you well: perforce I must confess
[10:14.59]	I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
[10:19.83]	O, that a lady, of one man refused.
[10:24.00]	Should of another therefore be abused!
[10:28.71]	[Exit]
[10:29.99]LYSANDER	She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
[10:35.34]	And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
[10:40.26]	For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
[10:45.18]	The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
[10:50.42]	Or as tie heresies that men do leave
[10:55.01]	Are hated most of those they did deceive,
[11:00.04]	So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
[11:04.21]	Of all be hated, but the most of me!
[11:08.60]	And, all my powers, address your love and might
[11:14.16]	To honour Helen and to be her knight!
[11:18.75]	[Exit]
[11:20.04]HERMIA	[Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
[11:25.28]	To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
[11:30.84]	Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
[11:35.44]	Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
[11:40.25]	Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
[11:44.96]	And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
[11:49.66]	Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
[11:54.15]	What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
[11:59.29]	Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
[12:04.31]	Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
[12:09.66]	No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
[12:14.69]	Either death or you I'll find immediately.
[12:19.82]	[Exit]
