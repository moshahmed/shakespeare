[00:00.48]	[Athens. QUINCE'S house.,]
[00:01.46]	[Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and
[00:01.95]	+ STARVELING]
[00:02.44]QUINCE	Is all our company here?
[00:04.89]BOTTOM	You were best to call them generally, man by man,
[00:09.29]	according to the scrip.
[00:11.66]QUINCE	Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
[00:16.07]	thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
[00:20.31]	interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
[00:24.79]	wedding-day at night.
[00:27.00]BOTTOM	First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
[00:31.48]	on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
[00:35.97]	to a point.
[00:37.36]QUINCE	Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
[00:41.84]	most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
[00:45.51]BOTTOM	A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
[00:49.67]	merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
[00:53.75]	actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
[00:58.08]QUINCE	Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
[01:02.15]BOTTOM	Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
[01:06.07]QUINCE	You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
[01:09.90]BOTTOM	What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
[01:13.33]QUINCE	A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
[01:17.82]BOTTOM	That will ask some tears in the true performing of
[01:22.47]	it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
[01:26.63]	eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
[01:30.95]	measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
[01:35.44]	tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
[01:39.76]	tear a cat in, to make all split.
[01:42.86]	The raging rocks
[01:44.74]	And shivering shocks
[01:46.94]	Shall break the locks
[01:49.22]	Of prison gates;
[01:51.02]	And Phibbus' car
[01:52.81]	Shall shine from far
[01:55.01]	And make and mar
[01:56.89]	The foolish Fates.
[01:58.85]	This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
[02:03.25]	This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
[02:07.58]	more condoling.
[02:09.29]QUINCE	Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
[02:12.47]FLUTE	Here, Peter Quince.
[02:14.43]QUINCE	Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
[02:17.69]FLUTE	What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
[02:20.95]QUINCE	It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
[02:24.54]FLUTE	Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
[02:29.60]QUINCE	That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
[02:33.92]	you may speak as small as you will.
[02:37.27]BOTTOM	An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
[02:41.84]	speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
[02:45.67]	Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
[02:49.83]	and lady dear!'
[02:51.46]QUINCE	No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
[02:55.95]BOTTOM	Well, proceed.
[02:57.50]QUINCE	Robin Starveling, the tailor.
[03:00.27]STARVELING	Here, Peter Quince.
[03:02.23]QUINCE	Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
[03:06.55]	Tom Snout, the tinker.
[03:08.76]SNOUT	Here, Peter Quince.
[03:10.71]QUINCE	You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
[03:14.63]	Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
[03:18.55]	hope, here is a play fitted.
[03:21.24]SNUG	Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
[03:25.64]	be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
[03:29.15]QUINCE	You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
[03:34.04]BOTTOM	Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
[03:38.53]	do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
[03:42.85]	that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
[03:47.34]	let him roar again.'
[03:49.38]QUINCE	An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
[03:53.95]	the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
[03:58.52]	and that were enough to hang us all.
[04:01.94]ALL	That would hang us, every mother's son.
[04:05.53]BOTTOM	I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
[04:10.10]	ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
[04:14.59]	discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
[04:19.15]	voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
[04:23.48]	sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
[04:27.39]	nightingale.
[04:28.86]QUINCE	You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
[04:33.43]	sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
[04:38.08]	summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
[04:42.32]	therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
[04:45.91]BOTTOM	Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
[04:50.32]	to play it in?
[04:51.95]QUINCE	Why, what you will.
[04:53.90]BOTTOM	I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
[04:58.31]	beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
[05:02.96]	beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
[05:07.12]	perfect yellow.
[05:08.83]QUINCE	Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
[05:13.48]	then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
[05:17.81]	are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
[05:22.13]	you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
[05:26.70]	and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
[05:31.27]	town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
[05:35.67]	we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
[05:39.75]	company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
[05:44.15]	will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
[05:48.56]	wants. I pray you, fail me not.
[05:51.41]BOTTOM	We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
[05:55.49]	obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.
[06:00.47]QUINCE	At the duke's oak we meet.
[06:03.08]BOTTOM	Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.
[06:06.10]	[Exeunt]
