[00:17.17]	[Athens. The palace of THESEUS.,]
[00:51.51]	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and
[01:08.68]	+ Attendants]
[01:23.00] ./Plays/12-A-Midsummer-Nights-Dream/12-A-Midsummer-Nights-Dream-Act-1-Scene-1.mp3 
[01:23.00]THESEUS	Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
[01:25.92]	Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
[01:29.12]	Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
[01:32.12]	This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
[01:35.53]	Like to a step-dame or a dowager
[01:38.25]	Long withering out a young man revenue.
[01:41.38]HIPPOLYTA	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
[01:45.21]	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
[01:48.76]	And then the moon, like to a silver bow
[01:51.89]	New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
[01:55.24]	Of our solemnities.
[01:56.98]THESEUS	Go, Philostrate,
[01:58.44]	Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
[02:01.71]	Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
[02:05.05]	Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
[02:07.84]	The pale companion is not for our pomp.
[02:10.97]	[Exit PHILOSTRATE]
[02:11.81]	Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
[02:14.80]	And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
[02:17.80]	But I will wed thee in another key,
[02:20.65]	With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
[02:24.00]	[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS]
[02:24.83]EGEUS	Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
[02:27.69]THESEUS	Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
[02:31.17]EGEUS	Full of vexation come I, with complaint
[02:34.30]	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
[02:37.23]	Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
[02:40.15]	This man hath my consent to marry her.
[02:43.22]	Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
[02:46.56]	This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
[02:50.18]	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
[02:53.80]	And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
[02:57.21]	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
[03:00.55]	With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
[03:04.04]	And stolen the impression of her fantasy
[03:07.31]	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
[03:11.07]	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
[03:14.69]	Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
[03:18.03]	With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
[03:22.00]	Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
[03:25.21]	To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
[03:28.62]	Be it so she; will not here before your grace
[03:32.17]	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
[03:34.81]	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
[03:37.88]	As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
[03:40.80]	Which shall be either to this gentleman
[03:44.01]	Or to her death, according to our law
[03:47.00]	Immediately provided in that case.
[03:49.79]THESEUS	What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
[03:53.06]	To you your father should be as a god;
[03:56.12]	One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
[03:59.61]	To whom you are but as a form in wax
[04:02.60]	By him imprinted and within his power
[04:05.66]	To leave the figure or disfigure it.
[04:08.59]	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
[04:11.23]HERMIA	So is Lysander.
[04:12.70]THESEUS	In himself he is;
[04:14.30]	But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
[04:17.85]	The other must be held the worthier.
[04:20.77]HERMIA	I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
[04:24.12]THESEUS	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
[04:27.67]HERMIA	I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
[04:30.66]	I know not by what power I am made bold,
[04:33.87]	Nor how it may concern my modesty,
[04:36.65]	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
[04:40.20]	But I beseech your grace that I may know
[04:43.48]	The worst that may befall me in this case,
[04:46.82]	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
[04:49.26]THESEUS	Either to die the death or to abjure
[04:52.25]	For ever the society of men.
[04:54.62]	Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
[04:58.10]	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
[05:01.51]	Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
[05:05.34]	You can endure the livery of a nun,
[05:08.20]	For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
[05:11.26]	To live a barren sister all your life,
[05:14.32]	Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
[05:18.08]	Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
[05:21.78]	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
[05:24.56]	But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
[05:27.90]	Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
[05:31.52]	Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
[05:34.94]HERMIA	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
[05:38.00]	Ere I will my virgin patent up
[05:40.58]	Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
[05:43.64]	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
[05:46.91]THESEUS	Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
[05:50.40]	The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
[05:53.53]	For everlasting bond of fellowship--
[05:56.38]	Upon that day either prepare to die
[05:59.31]	For disobedience to your father's will,
[06:02.44]	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
[06:05.44]	Or on Diana's altar to protest
[06:08.01]	For aye austerity and single life.
[06:10.80]DEMETRIUS	Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
[06:13.93]	Thy crazed title to my certain right.
[06:16.93]LYSANDER	You have her father's love, Demetrius;
[06:19.92]	Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
[06:22.98]EGEUS	Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
[06:26.12]	And what is mine my love shall render him.
[06:29.46]	And she is mine, and all my right of her
[06:32.66]	I do estate unto Demetrius.
[06:34.96]LYSANDER	I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
[06:37.82]	As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
[06:41.23]	My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
[06:44.36]	If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
[06:47.08]	And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
[06:50.77]	I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
[06:53.49]	Why should not I then prosecute my right?
[06:56.76]	Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
[06:59.75]	Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
[07:02.75]	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
[07:06.09]	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
[07:08.80]	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
[07:11.80]THESEUS	I must confess that I have heard so much,
[07:15.07]	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
[07:18.90]	But, being over-full of self-affairs,
[07:21.83]	My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
[07:24.96]	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
[07:27.88]	I have some private schooling for you both.
[07:31.30]	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
[07:34.64]	To fit your fancies to your father's will;
[07:37.98]	Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
[07:41.19]	Which by no means we may extenuate--
[07:44.04]	To death, or to a vow of single life.
[07:46.97]	Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
[07:49.96]	Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
[07:52.40]	I must employ you in some business
[07:55.25]	Against our nuptial and confer with you
[07:58.45]	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
[08:02.01]EGEUS	With duty and desire we follow you.
[08:04.86]	[Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA]
[08:05.70]LYSANDER	How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
[08:09.04]	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
[08:12.45]HERMIA	Belike for want of rain, which I could well
[08:15.86]	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
[08:19.07]LYSANDER	Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
[08:22.20]	Could ever hear by tale or history,
[08:25.06]	The course of true love never did run smooth;
[08:28.61]	But, either it was different in blood,--
[08:31.60]HERMIA	O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
[08:34.87]LYSANDER	Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
[08:38.01]HERMIA	O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
[08:41.14]LYSANDER	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
[08:44.62]HERMIA	O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
[08:47.83]LYSANDER	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
[08:50.89]	War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
[08:54.23]	Making it momentany as a sound,
[08:56.81]	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
[08:59.80]	Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
[09:03.29]	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
[09:06.98]	And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
[09:10.11]	The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
[09:13.10]	So quick bright things come to confusion.
[09:16.38]HERMIA	If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
[09:19.79]	It stands as an edict in destiny:
[09:22.50]	Then let us teach our trial patience,
[09:25.50]	Because it is a customary cross,
[09:28.15]	As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
[09:31.91]	Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
[09:35.11]LYSANDER	A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
[09:38.52]	I have a widow aunt, a dowager
[09:41.03]	Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
[09:44.16]	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
[09:47.78]	And she respects me as her only son.
[09:50.71]	There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
[09:53.70]	And to that place the sharp Athenian law
[09:56.97]	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
[10:00.18]	Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
[10:03.87]	And in the wood, a league without the town,
[10:07.21]	Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
[10:10.34]	To do observance to a morn of May,
[10:13.13]	There will I stay for thee.
[10:15.43]HERMIA	My good Lysander!
[10:17.03]	I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
[10:20.30]	By his best arrow with the golden head,
[10:23.44]	By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
[10:26.15]	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
[10:29.91]	And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
[10:33.74]	When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
[10:37.08]	By all the vows that ever men have broke,
[10:40.36]	In number more than ever women spoke,
[10:43.35]	In that same place thou hast appointed me,
[10:46.69]	To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
[10:49.76]LYSANDER	Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
[10:53.03]	[Enter HELENA]
[10:53.87]HERMIA	God speed fair Helena! whither away?
[10:56.72]HELENA	Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
[10:59.86]	Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
[11:02.99]	Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
[11:07.10]	More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
[11:10.44]	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
[11:14.06]	Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
[11:17.12]	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
[11:20.40]	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
[11:24.09]	My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
[11:27.99]	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
[11:31.33]	The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
[11:34.67]	O, teach me how you look, and with what art
[11:38.02]	You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
[11:41.15]HERMIA	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
[11:44.28]HELENA	O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
[11:48.32]HERMIA	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
[11:51.46]HELENA	O that my prayers could such affection move!
[11:54.94]HERMIA	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
[11:58.07]HELENA	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
[12:01.13]HERMIA	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
[12:04.13]HELENA	None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
[12:07.89]HERMIA	Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
[12:11.23]	Lysander and myself will fly this place.
[12:14.43]	Before the time I did Lysander see,
[12:17.29]	Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
[12:20.08]	O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
[12:23.21]	That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
[12:26.48]LYSANDER	Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
[12:29.55]	To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
[12:32.75]	Her silver visage in the watery glass,
[12:35.81]	Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
[12:39.23]	A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
[12:42.85]	Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
[12:46.47]HERMIA	And in the wood, where often you and I
[12:49.53]	Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
[12:52.87]	Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
[12:56.29]	There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
[12:59.49]	And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
[13:02.83]	To seek new friends and stranger companies.
[13:06.24]	Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
[13:09.66]	And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
[13:12.79]	Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
[13:16.27]	From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
[13:19.68]LYSANDER	I will, my Hermia.
[13:21.29]	[Exit HERMIA]
[13:22.12]	Helena, adieu:
[13:23.44]	As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
[13:26.37]	[Exit]
[13:27.20]HELENA	How happy some o'er other some can be!
[13:30.27]	Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
[13:33.68]	But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
[13:36.95]	He will not know what all but he do know:
[13:40.23]	And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
[13:43.36]	So I, admiring of his qualities:
[13:45.94]	Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
[13:49.21]	Love can transpose to form and dignity:
[13:52.34]	Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
[13:56.03]	And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
[13:59.51]	Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
[14:03.00]	Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
[14:06.13]	And therefore is Love said to be a child,
[14:09.40]	Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
[14:12.61]	As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
[14:16.09]	So the boy Love is perjured every where:
[14:19.29]	For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
[14:22.63]	He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
[14:26.05]	And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
[14:29.67]	So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
[14:33.29]	I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
[14:36.70]	Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
[14:39.97]	Pursue her; and for this intelligence
[14:42.97]	If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
[14:46.03]	But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
[14:48.96]	To have his sight thither and back again.
[14:52.23]	[Exit]
