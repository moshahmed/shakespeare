[00:00.46]	[Orleans. Within the town.,]
[00:01.40]	[Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others]
[00:02.34]BEDFORD	The day begins to break, and night is fled,
[00:06.10]	Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
[00:09.86]	Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.
[00:13.85]	[Retreat sounded]
[00:14.79]TALBOT	Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,
[00:18.24]	And here advance it in the market-place,
[00:21.84]	The middle centre of this cursed town.
[00:25.29]	Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;
[00:28.65]	For every drop of blood was drawn from him,
[00:32.49]	There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
[00:36.72]	And that hereafter ages may behold
[00:39.93]	What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,
[00:43.30]	Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
[00:46.90]	A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:
[00:50.81]	Upon the which, that every one may read,
[00:54.34]	Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,
[00:57.78]	The treacherous manner of his mournful death
[01:01.78]	And what a terror he had been to France.
[01:05.38]	But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
[01:08.74]	I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
[01:12.58]	His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,
[01:16.42]	Nor any of his false confederates.
[01:19.55]BEDFORD	'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
[01:23.54]	Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
[01:27.46]	They did amongst the troops of armed men
[01:31.14]	Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
[01:35.05]BURGUNDY	Myself, as far as I could well discern
[01:38.50]	For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,
[01:42.18]	Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
[01:46.02]	When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
[01:50.17]	Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
[01:53.61]	That could not live asunder day or night.
[01:57.29]	After that things are set in order here,
[02:00.89]	We'll follow them with all the power we have.
[02:04.89]	[Enter a Messenger]
[02:05.83]Messenger	All hail, my lords! which of this princely train
[02:09.98]	Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts
[02:13.58]	So much applauded through the realm of France?
[02:17.65]TALBOT	Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
[02:21.57]Messenger	The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
[02:25.09]	With modesty admiring thy renown,
[02:28.14]	By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
[02:32.45]	To visit her poor castle where she lies,
[02:36.05]	That she may boast she hath beheld the man
[02:39.89]	Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
[02:43.88]BURGUNDY	Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars
[02:47.33]	Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,
[02:50.77]	When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
[02:54.45]	You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.
[02:58.37]TALBOT	Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
[03:02.28]	Could not prevail with all their oratory,
[03:05.96]	Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:
[03:09.49]	And therefore tell her I return great thanks,
[03:13.48]	And in submission will attend on her.
[03:16.85]	Will not your honours bear me company?
[03:20.29]BEDFORD	No, truly; it is more than manners will:
[03:23.74]	And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
[03:27.42]	Are often welcomest when they are gone.
[03:30.94]TALBOT	Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,
[03:34.54]	I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.
[03:37.91]	Come hither, captain.
[03:39.95]	[Whispers]
[03:40.89]	You perceive my mind?
[03:43.00]Captain	I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.
[03:46.13]	[Exeunt]
