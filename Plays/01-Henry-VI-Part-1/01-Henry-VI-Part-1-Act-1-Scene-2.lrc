[00:00.41]	[France. Before Orleans.,]
[00:01.25]	[Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and
[00:01.67]	+ REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers]
[00:02.09]CHARLES	Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
[00:05.57]	So in the earth, to this day is not known:
[00:08.85]	Late did he shine upon the English side;
[00:12.06]	Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
[00:15.05]	What towns of any moment but we have?
[00:18.05]	At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
[00:21.05]	Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,
[00:24.95]	Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
[00:28.09]ALENCON	They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:
[00:32.06]	Either they must be dieted like mules
[00:35.13]	And have their provender tied to their mouths
[00:38.76]	Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
[00:42.24]REIGNIER	Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
[00:45.73]	Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:
[00:48.73]	Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;
[00:52.00]	And he may well in fretting spend his gall,
[00:55.42]	Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
[00:58.49]CHARLES	Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
[01:01.69]	Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
[01:04.97]	Him I forgive my death that killeth me
[01:08.11]	When he sees me go back one foot or fly.
[01:11.31]	[Exeunt]
[01:12.15]	[Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English
[01:12.57]	+ with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER]
[01:12.99]CHARLES	Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
[01:16.06]	Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,
[01:19.68]	But that they left me 'midst my enemies.
[01:22.82]REIGNIER	Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
[01:25.61]	He fighteth as one weary of his life.
[01:28.60]	The other lords, like lions wanting food,
[01:31.81]	Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
[01:34.81]ALENCON	Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,
[01:37.95]	England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
[01:41.01]	During the time Edward the Third did reign.
[01:44.43]	More truly now may this be verified;
[01:47.36]	For none but Samsons and Goliases
[01:50.15]	It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
[01:53.35]	Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose
[01:56.98]	They had such courage and audacity?
[01:59.84]CHARLES	Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,
[02:04.09]	And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
[02:07.71]	Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
[02:11.13]	The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
[02:15.10]REIGNIER	I think, by some odd gimmors or device
[02:18.17]	Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;
[02:22.08]	Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
[02:25.63]	By my consent, we'll even let them alone.
[02:28.84]ALENCON	Be it so.
[02:29.88]	[Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS]
[02:30.72]BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
[02:34.42]CHARLES	Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.
[02:37.62]BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:
[02:41.39]	Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
[02:44.94]	Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:
[02:48.01]	A holy maid hither with me I bring,
[02:50.87]	Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
[02:54.21]	Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
[02:57.42]	And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
[03:01.26]	The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
[03:04.25]	Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
[03:07.32]	What's past and what's to come she can descry.
[03:10.95]	Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
[03:14.36]	For they are certain and unfallible.
[03:17.29]CHARLES	Go, call her in.
[03:18.75]	[Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS]
[03:19.59]	But first, to try her skill,
[03:21.89]	Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
[03:25.31]	Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
[03:28.79]	By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
[03:32.63]	[Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE]
[03:33.46]REIGNIER	Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
[03:37.30]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
[03:40.99]	Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;
[03:44.41]	I know thee well, though never seen before.
[03:47.76]	Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:
[03:51.10]	In private will I talk with thee apart.
[03:54.24]	Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
[03:57.87]REIGNIER	She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
[04:01.14]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
[04:04.63]	My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
[04:07.56]	Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
[04:11.11]	To shine on my contemptible estate:
[04:13.97]	Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
[04:17.04]	And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
[04:20.73]	God's mother deigned to appear to me
[04:23.73]	And in a vision full of majesty
[04:26.38]	Will'd me to leave my base vocation
[04:29.31]	And free my country from calamity:
[04:32.10]	Her aid she promised and assured success:
[04:35.37]	In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
[04:38.51]	And, whereas I was black and swart before,
[04:41.79]	With those clear rays which she infused on me
[04:45.41]	That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
[04:48.90]	Ask me what question thou canst possible,
[04:52.17]	And I will answer unpremeditated:
[04:54.89]	My courage try by combat, if thou darest,
[04:58.10]	And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
[05:01.38]	Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
[05:04.58]	If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
[05:07.79]CHARLES	Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
[05:11.28]	Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
[05:14.48]	In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,
[05:17.90]	And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
[05:21.32]	Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
[05:24.24]JOAN LA PUCELLE	I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,
[05:27.59]	Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;
[05:31.22]	The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's
[05:34.63]	churchyard,
[05:35.82]	Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
[05:39.44]CHARLES	Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.
[05:42.58]JOAN LA PUCELLE	And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.
[05:45.99]	[Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes]
[05:46.83]CHARLES	Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon
[05:49.97]	And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
[05:53.11]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
[05:56.73]CHARLES	Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:
[06:00.36]	Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
[06:03.21]	My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
[06:06.77]	Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
[06:09.70]	Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:
[06:12.91]	'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
[06:16.25]JOAN LA PUCELLE	I must not yield to any rites of love,
[06:19.32]	For my profession's sacred from above:
[06:22.39]	When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
[06:25.80]	Then will I think upon a recompense.
[06:28.73]CHARLES	Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
[06:32.43]REIGNIER	My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
[06:35.49]ALENCON	Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
[06:39.05]	Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
[06:42.81]REIGNIER	Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
[06:46.30]ALENCON	He may mean more than we poor men do know:
[06:49.65]	These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
[06:53.62]REIGNIER	My lord, where are you? what devise you on?
[06:56.90]	Shall we give over Orleans, or no?
[06:59.61]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!
[07:02.47]	Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
[07:06.10]CHARLES	What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
[07:09.72]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
[07:12.93]	This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
[07:16.28]	Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,
[07:19.62]	Since I have entered into these wars.
[07:22.62]	Glory is like a circle in the water,
[07:25.55]	Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
[07:28.62]	Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
[07:32.24]	With Henry's death the English circle ends;
[07:35.66]	Dispersed are the glories it included.
[07:38.73]	Now am I like that proud insulting ship
[07:41.93]	Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.
[07:45.28]CHARLES	Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
[07:48.00]	Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
[07:51.00]	Helen, the mother of great Constantine,
[07:54.06]	Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.
[07:57.83]	Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
[08:01.45]	How may I reverently worship thee enough?
[08:04.73]ALENCON	Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
[08:08.22]REIGNIER	Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;
[08:11.77]	Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.
[08:15.26]CHARLES	Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:
[08:18.81]	No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.
[08:22.23]	[Exeunt]
