[00:00.42]	[Camp of the YORK in Anjou.,]
[00:01.27]	[Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others]
[00:02.12]YORK	Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
[00:05.73]	[Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd]
[00:06.58]Shepherd	Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
[00:10.33]	Have I sought every country far and near,
[00:13.66]	And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
[00:16.98]	Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
[00:20.17]	Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!
[00:23.92]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
[00:26.82]	I am descended of a gentler blood:
[00:29.65]	Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
[00:32.98]Shepherd	Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;
[00:36.38]	I did beget her, all the parish knows:
[00:39.42]	Her mother liveth yet, can testify
[00:42.25]	She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.
[00:45.72]WARWICK	Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?
[00:48.90]YORK	This argues what her kind of life hath been,
[00:52.44]	Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.
[00:55.91]Shepherd	Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
[00:59.10]	God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
[01:02.35]	And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:
[01:05.68]	Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.
[01:08.51]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,
[01:11.91]	Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
[01:14.95]Shepherd	'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
[01:18.06]	The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
[01:21.39]	Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
[01:25.00]	Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
[01:28.47]	Of thy nativity! I would the milk
[01:31.23]	Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,
[01:35.26]	Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
[01:38.52]	Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
[01:42.20]	I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
[01:45.53]	Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
[01:48.64]	O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.
[01:51.90]	[Exit]
[01:52.75]YORK	Take her away; for she hath lived too long,
[01:56.14]	To fill the world with vicious qualities.
[01:59.47]JOAN LA PUCELLE	First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
[02:03.15]	Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
[02:06.12]	But issued from the progeny of kings;
[02:09.17]	Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,
[02:12.14]	By inspiration of celestial grace,
[02:14.97]	To work exceeding miracles on earth.
[02:17.94]	I never had to do with wicked spirits:
[02:21.06]	But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
[02:24.46]	Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,
[02:28.14]	Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
[02:31.53]	Because you want the grace that others have,
[02:35.07]	You judge it straight a thing impossible
[02:38.40]	To compass wonders but by help of devils.
[02:41.73]	No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
[02:44.84]	A virgin from her tender infancy,
[02:47.60]	Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
[02:50.71]	Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,
[02:54.18]	Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
[02:57.86]YORK	Ay, ay: away with her to execution!
[03:00.62]WARWICK	And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,
[03:03.81]	Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:
[03:06.99]	Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,
[03:10.53]	That so her torture may be shortened.
[03:13.58]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
[03:16.97]	Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,
[03:19.88]	That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
[03:23.34]	I am with child, ye bloody homicides:
[03:26.32]	Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
[03:29.64]	Although ye hale me to a violent death.
[03:32.83]YORK	Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!
[03:36.37]WARWICK	The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
[03:39.76]	Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
[03:43.30]YORK	She and the Dauphin have been juggling:
[03:46.49]	I did imagine what would be her refuge.
[03:49.67]WARWICK	Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;
[03:52.86]	Especially since Charles must father it.
[03:56.11]JOAN LA PUCELLE	You are deceived; my child is none of his:
[03:59.44]	It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.
[04:02.41]YORK	Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!
[04:05.17]	It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.
[04:08.29]JOAN LA PUCELLE	O, give me leave, I have deluded you:
[04:11.19]	'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,
[04:14.87]	But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.
[04:18.34]WARWICK	A married man! that's most intolerable.
[04:21.45]YORK	Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,
[04:25.06]	There were so many, whom she may accuse.
[04:28.25]WARWICK	It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
[04:31.57]YORK	And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.
[04:34.69]	Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:
[04:38.30]	Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
[04:41.13]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:
[04:44.81]	May never glorious sun reflex his beams
[04:48.07]	Upon the country where you make abode;
[04:51.18]	But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
[04:54.65]	Environ you, till mischief and despair
[04:57.76]	Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
[05:01.66]	[Exit, guarded]
[05:02.50]YORK	Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,
[05:05.90]	Thou foul accursed minister of hell!
[05:08.87]	[Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER, attended]
[05:09.72]CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER	Lord regent, I do greet your excellence
[05:12.91]	With letters of commission from the king.
[05:16.24]	For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
[05:19.77]	Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,
[05:23.46]	Have earnestly implored a general peace
[05:26.71]	Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
[05:30.18]	And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
[05:33.65]	Approacheth, to confer about some matter.
[05:36.90]YORK	Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
[05:40.23]	After the slaughter of so many peers,
[05:43.27]	So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,
[05:46.53]	That in this quarrel have been overthrown
[05:49.93]	And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
[05:53.89]	Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
[05:57.36]	Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
[06:00.90]	By treason, falsehood and by treachery,
[06:04.01]	Our great progenitors had conquered?
[06:06.98]	O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
[06:10.17]	The utter loss of all the realm of France.
[06:13.57]WARWICK	Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,
[06:16.75]	It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
[06:20.72]	As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.
[06:24.18]	[Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS,
[06:24.61]	+ REIGNIER, and others]
[06:25.03]CHARLES	Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
[06:28.36]	That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,
[06:32.32]	We come to be informed by yourselves
[06:35.37]	What the conditions of that league must be.
[06:38.84]YORK	Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes
[06:42.30]	The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,
[06:45.56]	By sight of these our baleful enemies.
[06:48.67]CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER	Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
[06:51.93]	That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
[06:55.18]	Of mere compassion and of lenity,
[06:57.95]	To ease your country of distressful war,
[07:01.20]	And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
[07:04.74]	You shall become true liegemen to his crown:
[07:08.28]	And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
[07:11.75]	To pay him tribute, submit thyself,
[07:14.58]	Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,
[07:17.98]	And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
[07:20.81]ALENCON	Must he be then as shadow of himself?
[07:23.85]	Adorn his temples with a coronet,
[07:26.61]	And yet, in substance and authority,
[07:29.51]	Retain but privilege of a private man?
[07:32.63]	This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
[07:35.74]CHARLES	'Tis known already that I am possess'd
[07:38.86]	With more than half the Gallian territories,
[07:42.39]	And therein reverenced for their lawful king:
[07:46.00]	Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,
[07:49.47]	Detract so much from that prerogative,
[07:52.59]	As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
[07:55.91]	No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
[07:58.89]	That which I have than, coveting for more,
[08:02.21]	Be cast from possibility of all.
[08:04.90]YORK	Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means
[08:08.44]	Used intercession to obtain a league,
[08:11.48]	And, now the matter grows to compromise,
[08:14.67]	Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?
[08:17.64]	Either accept the title thou usurp'st,
[08:20.76]	Of benefit proceeding from our king
[08:23.73]	And not of any challenge of desert,
[08:26.63]	Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
[08:30.10]REIGNIER	My lord, you do not well in obstinacy
[08:33.14]	To cavil in the course of this contract:
[08:36.40]	If once it be neglected, ten to one
[08:39.30]	We shall not find like opportunity.
[08:42.20]ALENCON	To say the truth, it is your policy
[08:45.10]	To save your subjects from such massacre
[08:48.43]	And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
[08:51.83]	By our proceeding in hostility;
[08:54.45]	And therefore take this compact of a truce,
[08:57.92]	Although you break it when your pleasure serves.
[09:01.74]WARWICK	How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?
[09:05.70]CHARLES	It shall;
[09:06.76]	Only reserved, you claim no interest
[09:09.74]	In any of our towns of garrison.
[09:12.43]YORK	Then swear allegiance to his majesty,
[09:15.47]	As thou art knight, never to disobey
[09:18.44]	Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,
[09:21.84]	Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.
[09:25.38]	So, now dismiss your army when ye please:
[09:28.63]	Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,
[09:32.17]	For here we entertain a solemn peace.
[09:35.22]	[Exeunt]
