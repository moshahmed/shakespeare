[00:00.51]	[Another part of the field.,]
[00:01.54]	[Alarum: excursions. Enter TALBOT led by a Servant]
[00:02.58]TALBOT	Where is my other life? mine own is gone;
[00:06.53]	O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?
[00:10.92]	Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,
[00:14.87]	Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:
[00:19.26]	When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,
[00:23.47]	His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
[00:27.34]	And, like a hungry lion, did commence
[00:30.96]	Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
[00:35.00]	But when my angry guardant stood alone,
[00:38.87]	Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,
[00:42.74]	Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart
[00:46.69]	Suddenly made him from my side to start
[00:50.65]	Into the clustering battle of the French;
[00:54.69]	And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
[00:58.91]	His over-mounting spirit, and there died,
[01:02.86]	My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.
[01:06.30]Servant	O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!
[01:10.43]	[Enter Soldiers, with the body of JOHN TALBOT]
[01:11.46]TALBOT	Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,
[01:16.19]	Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
[01:19.46]	Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
[01:22.64]	Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
[01:26.77]	In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
[01:30.47]	O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,
[01:35.03]	Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
[01:39.50]	Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;
[01:43.97]	Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
[01:47.58]	Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
[01:52.05]	Had death been French, then death had died to-day.
[01:56.78]	Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:
[02:01.00]	My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
[02:05.04]	Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,
[02:09.00]	Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.
[02:13.47]	[Dies]
[02:14.50]	[Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BURGUNDY, BASTARD OF
[02:15.02]	+ ORLEANS, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces]
[02:15.53]CHARLES	Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,
[02:19.49]	We should have found a bloody day of this.
[02:23.62]BASTARD OF ORLEANS	How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,
[02:27.92]	Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!
[02:32.39]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:
[02:36.26]	'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'
[02:40.39]	But, with a proud majestical high scorn,
[02:44.26]	He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
[02:48.47]	To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'
[02:52.08]	So, rushing in the bowels of the French,
[02:55.95]	He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.
[02:59.65]BURGUNDY	Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;
[03:03.95]	See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms
[03:07.91]	Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!
[03:11.78]BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder
[03:16.08]	Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder.
[03:20.63]CHARLES	O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled
[03:24.68]	During the life, let us not wrong it dead.
[03:28.72]	[Enter Sir William LUCY, attended; Herald of the
[03:29.24]	+ French preceding]
[03:29.75]LUCY	Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,
[03:33.71]	To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.
[03:38.27]CHARLES	On what submissive message art thou sent?
[03:42.31]LUCY	Submission, Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word;
[03:46.44]	We English warriors wot not what it means.
[03:50.56]	I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en
[03:55.04]	And to survey the bodies of the dead.
[03:58.73]CHARLES	For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.
[04:03.12]	But tell me whom thou seek'st.
[04:06.22]LUCY	But where's the great Alcides of the field,
[04:10.43]	Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,
[04:14.30]	Created, for his rare success in arms,
[04:18.00]	Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence;
[04:22.38]	Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,
[04:26.25]	Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton,
[04:30.81]	Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,
[04:35.97]	The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge;
[04:40.19]	Knight of the noble order of Saint George,
[04:44.31]	Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece;
[04:48.53]	Great marshal to Henry the Sixth
[04:51.88]	Of all his wars within the realm of France?
[04:56.10]JOAN LA PUCELLE	Here is a silly stately style indeed!
[04:59.79]	The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,
[05:03.92]	Writes not so tedious a style as this.
[05:07.71]	Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
[05:12.26]	Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.
[05:16.65]LUCY	Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge,
[05:21.04]	Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?
[05:24.99]	O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,
[05:29.03]	That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!
[05:33.51]	O, that I could but call these dead to life!
[05:37.72]	It were enough to fright the realm of France:
[05:42.11]	Were but his picture left amongst you here,
[05:46.32]	It would amaze the proudest of you all.
[05:50.19]	Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence
[05:54.83]	And give them burial as beseems their worth.
[05:59.13]JOAN LA PUCELLE	I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
[06:03.35]	He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.
[06:07.82]	For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,
[06:12.55]	They would but stink, and putrefy the air.
[06:16.59]CHARLES	Go, take their bodies hence.
[06:19.43]LUCY	I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd
[06:24.93]	A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
[06:29.23]CHARLES	So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt.
[06:33.79]	And now to Paris, in this conquering vein:
[06:37.83]	All will be ours, now bloody Talbot's slain.
[06:42.05]	[Exeunt]
