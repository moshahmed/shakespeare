[00:00.46]	[London. Before the Tower.,]
[00:01.38]	[Enter GLOUCESTER, with his Serving-men in blue coats]
[00:02.31]GLOUCESTER	I am come to survey the Tower this day:
[00:05.77]	Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.
[00:09.86]	Where be these warders, that they wait not here?
[00:13.94]	Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.
[00:17.56]First Warder	[Within] Who's there that knocks so imperiously?
[00:21.49]First Serving-Man	It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.
[00:24.65]Second Warder	[Within] Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.
[00:28.35]First Serving-Man	Villains, answer you so the lord protector?
[00:32.05]First Warder	[Within] The Lord protect him! so we answer him:
[00:35.91]	We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
[00:39.30]GLOUCESTER	Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?
[00:43.23]	There's none protector of the realm but I.
[00:46.92]	Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.
[00:50.70]	Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
[00:54.48]	[Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and
[00:54.94]	+ WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within]
[00:55.40]WOODVILE	What noise is this? what traitors have we here?
[00:59.41]GLOUCESTER	Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
[01:02.95]	Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.
[01:07.27]WOODVILE	Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;
[01:10.81]	The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:
[01:13.97]	From him I have express commandment
[01:17.21]	That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
[01:21.06]GLOUCESTER	Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?
[01:24.84]	Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,
[01:28.46]	Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?
[01:32.62]	Thou art no friend to God or to the king:
[01:36.24]	Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.
[01:40.17]Serving-Men	Open the gates unto the lord protector,
[01:43.64]	Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.
[01:48.27]	[Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP
[01:48.73]	+ OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats]
[01:49.19]BISHOP OF WINCHESTER	How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?
[01:52.89]GLOUCESTER	Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?
[01:57.20]BISHOP OF WINCHESTER	I do, thou most usurping proditor,
[02:00.21]	And not protector, of the king or realm.
[02:03.68]GLOUCESTER	Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,
[02:06.99]	Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;
[02:11.00]	Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:
[02:14.77]	I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,
[02:18.78]	If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
[02:22.17]BISHOP OF WINCHESTER	Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:
[02:26.02]	This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,
[02:29.34]	To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
[02:32.73]GLOUCESTER	I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:
[02:36.74]	Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
[02:40.67]	I'll use to carry thee out of this place.
[02:44.29]BISHOP OF WINCHESTER	Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.
[02:48.22]GLOUCESTER	What! am I dared and bearded to my face?
[02:51.69]	Draw, men, for all this privileged place;
[02:55.15]	Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,
[02:59.55]	I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:
[03:03.17]	Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:
[03:06.79]	In spite of pope or dignities of church,
[03:10.33]	Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.
[03:14.34]BISHOP OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.
[03:18.58]GLOUCESTER	Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!
[03:21.89]	Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?
[03:25.82]	Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.
[03:30.06]	Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!
[03:33.45]	[Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF
[03:33.92]	+ WINCHESTER's men, and enter in the hurly-
[03:34.38]	+ burly the Mayor of London and his Officers]
[03:34.84]Mayor	Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,
[03:38.77]	Thus contumeliously should break the peace!
[03:42.55]GLOUCESTER	Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:
[03:46.48]	Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,
[03:50.48]	Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
[03:54.18]BISHOP OF WINCHESTER	Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,
[03:57.42]	One that still motions war and never peace,
[04:01.19]	O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,
[04:05.28]	That seeks to overthrow religion,
[04:08.28]	Because he is protector of the realm,
[04:11.60]	And would have armour here out of the Tower,
[04:15.45]	To crown himself king and suppress the prince.
[04:19.46]GLOUCESTER	I will not answer thee with words, but blows.
[04:23.31]	[Here they skirmish again]
[04:24.24]Mayor	Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife
[04:28.24]	But to make open proclamation:
[04:31.02]	Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,
[04:34.56]	Cry.
[04:35.33]Officer	All manner of men assembled here in arms this day
[04:39.65]	against God's peace and the king's, we charge and
[04:43.89]	command you, in his highness' name, to repair to
[04:47.89]	your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,
[04:51.82]	handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,
[04:55.45]	henceforward, upon pain of death.
[04:58.37]GLOUCESTER	Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:
[05:01.84]	But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.
[05:05.93]BISHOP OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:
[05:09.78]	Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.
[05:13.94]Mayor	I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.
[05:17.56]	This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
[05:21.41]GLOUCESTER	Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.
[05:25.34]BISHOP OF WINCHESTER	Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;
[05:28.66]	For I intend to have it ere long.
[05:31.66]	[Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF
[05:32.13]	+ WINCHESTER with their Serving-men]
[05:32.59]Mayor	See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
[05:36.60]	Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
[05:40.76]	I myself fight not once in forty year.
[05:44.15]	[Exeunt]
