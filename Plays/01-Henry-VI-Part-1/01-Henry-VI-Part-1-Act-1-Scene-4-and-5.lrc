[00:00.63]	[Orleans.,]
[00:01.90]	[Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy]
[00:03.17]Master-Gunner	Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,
[00:08.47]	And how the English have the suburbs won.
[00:13.45]Boy	Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,
[00:18.32]	Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.
[00:22.77]Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:
[00:27.96]	Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
[00:32.62]	Something I must do to procure me grace.
[00:37.49]	The prince's espials have informed me
[00:42.15]	How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,
[00:47.87]	Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
[00:52.85]	In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
[00:57.40]	And thence discover how with most advantage
[01:02.70]	They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
[01:07.79]	To intercept this inconvenience,
[01:11.81]	A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;
[01:17.11]	And even these three days have I watch'd,
[01:22.08]	If I could see them.
[01:24.84]	Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.
[01:30.03]	If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
[01:35.01]	And thou shalt find me at the governor's.
[01:39.99]	[Exit]
[01:41.26]Boy	Father, I warrant you; take you no care;
[01:45.92]	I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.
[01:50.90]	[Exit]
[01:52.17]	[Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT,
[01:52.80]	+ GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others]
[01:53.44]SALISBURY	Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!
[01:57.99]	How wert thou handled being prisoner?
[02:02.55]	Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
[02:07.84]	Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
[02:12.82]TALBOT	The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
[02:17.16]	Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
[02:22.46]	For him was I exchanged and ransomed.
[02:27.01]	But with a baser man of arms by far
[02:31.46]	Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
[02:36.87]	Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,
[02:42.16]	Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
[02:47.03]	In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.
[02:51.48]	But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,
[02:57.10]	Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
[03:01.97]	If I now had him brought into my power.
[03:06.74]SALISBURY	Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
[03:12.35]TALBOT	With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
[03:17.96]	In open market-place produced they me,
[03:22.62]	To be a public spectacle to all:
[03:26.65]	Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
[03:31.84]	The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
[03:37.24]	Then broke I from the officers that led me,
[03:42.43]	And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,
[03:48.36]	To hurl at the beholders of my shame:
[03:52.92]	My grisly countenance made others fly;
[03:57.58]	None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
[04:03.09]	In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
[04:07.96]	So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,
[04:13.68]	That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,
[04:19.19]	And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
[04:23.74]	Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
[04:28.51]	That walked about me every minute-while;
[04:33.38]	And if I did but stir out of my bed,
[04:37.83]	Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
[04:42.81]	[Enter the Boy with a linstock]
[04:44.08]SALISBURY	I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
[04:49.27]	But we will be revenged sufficiently
[04:53.82]	Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
[04:57.95]	Here, through this grate, I count each one
[05:02.93]	and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:
[05:07.80]	Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
[05:13.52]	Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,
[05:19.03]	Let me have your express opinions
[05:23.27]	Where is best place to make our battery next.
[05:28.67]GARGRAVE	I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.
[05:34.39]GLANSDALE	And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
[05:39.26]TALBOT	For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,
[05:44.45]	Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
[05:48.80]	[Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall]
[05:50.07]SALISBURY	O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!
[05:55.05]GARGRAVE	O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!
[05:59.28]TALBOT	What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
[06:05.21]	Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
[06:10.62]	How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?
[06:15.70]	One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
[06:21.42]	Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
[06:25.76]	That hath contrived this woful tragedy!
[06:30.53]	In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
[06:35.30]	Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
[06:40.70]	Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,
[06:46.10]	His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
[06:51.82]	Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
[06:58.17]	One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:
[07:03.68]	The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
[07:08.87]	Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
[07:13.53]	If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
[07:18.19]	Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
[07:23.38]	Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
[07:28.15]	Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
[07:32.71]	Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;
[07:38.11]	Thou shalt not die whiles--
[07:41.50]	He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
[07:46.58]	As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
[07:51.67]	Remember to avenge me on the French.'
[07:56.11]	Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
[08:00.77]	Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
[08:05.86]	Wretched shall France be only in my name.
[08:10.84]	[Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]
[08:12.11]	What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?
[08:17.72]	Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
[08:22.59]	[Enter a Messenger]
[08:23.87]Messenger	My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:
[08:29.37]	The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,
[08:34.67]	A holy prophetess new risen up,
[08:38.59]	Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
[08:44.10]	[Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans]
[08:45.37]TALBOT	Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
[08:50.35]	It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
[08:55.22]	Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:
[08:59.77]	Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,
[09:04.33]	Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,
[09:10.15]	And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
[09:15.34]	Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
[09:19.58]	And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
[09:25.83]	[Alarum. Exeunt]
