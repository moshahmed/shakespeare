[00:00.37]	[Plains in Gascony.,]
[00:01.13]	[Enter a Messenger that meets YORK. Enter YORK
[00:01.51]	+ with trumpet and many Soldiers]
[00:01.89]YORK	Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,
[00:04.86]	That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?
[00:07.96]Messenger	They are return'd, my lord, and give it out
[00:10.99]	That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,
[00:14.34]	To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,
[00:17.31]	By your espials were discovered
[00:19.72]	Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,
[00:23.00]	Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.
[00:26.98]YORK	A plague upon that villain Somerset,
[00:29.64]	That thus delays my promised supply
[00:32.29]	Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
[00:35.45]	Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,
[00:38.05]	And I am lowted by a traitor villain
[00:40.76]	And cannot help the noble chevalier:
[00:43.42]	God comfort him in this necessity!
[00:45.95]	If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.
[00:48.79]	[Enter Sir William LUCY]
[00:49.55]LUCY	Thou princely leader of our English strength,
[00:52.77]	Never so needful on the earth of France,
[00:55.68]	Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,
[00:58.52]	Who now is girdled with a waist of iron
[01:01.43]	And hemm'd about with grim destruction:
[01:04.28]	To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!
[01:07.44]	Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.
[01:10.91]YORK	O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart
[01:13.76]	Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
[01:16.92]	So should we save a valiant gentleman
[01:19.70]	By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.
[01:22.42]	Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,
[01:25.32]	That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.
[01:28.55]LUCY	O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!
[01:31.58]YORK	He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
[01:34.49]	We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;
[01:37.78]	All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.
[01:40.62]LUCY	Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;
[01:43.72]	And on his son young John, who two hours since
[01:47.00]	I met in travel toward his warlike father!
[01:50.04]	This seven years did not Talbot see his son;
[01:53.20]	And now they meet where both their lives are done.
[01:56.74]YORK	Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have
[01:59.52]	To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
[02:02.55]	Away! vexation almost stops my breath,
[02:05.27]	That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.
[02:08.75]	Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
[02:11.47]	But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.
[02:14.44]	Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,
[02:17.66]	'Long all of Somerset and his delay.
[02:20.25]	[Exit, with his soldiers]
[02:21.01]LUCY	Thus, while the vulture of sedition
[02:23.60]	Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,
[02:26.76]	Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
[02:29.67]	The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,
[02:32.70]	That ever living man of memory,
[02:35.04]	Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,
[02:38.27]	Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.
[02:41.30]	[Exit]
