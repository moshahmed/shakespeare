[00:00.38]	[London. The palace.,]
[00:01.14]	[Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR,
[00:01.52]	+ SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others]
[00:01.90]KING HENRY IV	My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
[00:04.95]	Unapt to stir at these indignities,
[00:07.55]	And you have found me; for accordingly
[00:10.35]	You tread upon my patience: but be sure
[00:13.20]	I will from henceforth rather be myself,
[00:16.13]	Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;
[00:19.17]	Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
[00:22.67]	And therefore lost that title of respect
[00:25.65]	Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
[00:29.15]EARL OF WORCESTER	Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
[00:32.38]	The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
[00:35.43]	And that same greatness too which our own hands
[00:38.86]	Have holp to make so portly.
[00:41.02]NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord.--
[00:41.91]KING HENRY IV	Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
[00:44.64]	Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
[00:47.37]	O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
[00:50.74]	And majesty might never yet endure
[00:53.34]	The moody frontier of a servant brow.
[00:56.07]	You have good leave to leave us: when we need
[00:59.31]	Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
[01:02.42]	[Exit Worcester]
[01:03.19]	You were about to speak.
[01:05.09]	[To North]
[01:05.85]NORTHUMBERLAND	Yea, my good lord.
[01:07.31]	Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
[01:10.68]	Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
[01:13.60]	Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
[01:16.90]	As is deliver'd to your majesty:
[01:19.32]	Either envy, therefore, or misprison
[01:21.92]	Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
[01:24.78]HOTSPUR	My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
[01:27.25]	But I remember, when the fight was done,
[01:30.11]	When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
[01:33.16]	Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
[01:36.27]	Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
[01:39.83]	Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
[01:43.13]	Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
[01:46.24]	He was perfumed like a milliner;
[01:48.66]	And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
[01:51.77]	A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
[01:54.31]	He gave his nose and took't away again;
[01:57.17]	Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
[02:00.34]	Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
[02:03.77]	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
[02:06.69]	He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
[02:09.74]	To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
[02:12.47]	Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
[02:15.01]	With many holiday and lady terms
[02:17.49]	He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
[02:20.60]	My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
[02:23.40]	I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
[02:26.70]	To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
[02:29.24]	Out of my grief and my impatience,
[02:31.78]	Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
[02:34.57]	He should or he should not; for he made me mad
[02:37.88]	To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
[02:41.11]	And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
[02:43.97]	Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
[02:47.34]	And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
[02:50.70]	Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
[02:53.31]	And that it was great pity, so it was,
[02:56.04]	This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
[02:59.15]	Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
[03:02.07]	Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
[03:05.25]	So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
[03:08.17]	He would himself have been a soldier.
[03:10.90]	This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
[03:13.82]	I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
[03:16.23]	And I beseech you, let not his report
[03:18.97]	Come current for an accusation
[03:21.32]	Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
[03:24.11]SIR WALTER BLUNT	The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
[03:27.09]	Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
[03:30.02]	To such a person and in such a place,
[03:32.75]	At such a time, with all the rest retold,
[03:35.67]	May reasonably die and never rise
[03:38.21]	To do him wrong or any way impeach
[03:40.81]	What then he said, so he unsay it now.
[03:43.54]KING HENRY IV	Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
[03:46.15]	But with proviso and exception,
[03:48.50]	That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
[03:51.93]	His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
[03:54.85]	Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
[03:57.64]	The lives of those that he did lead to fight
[04:00.88]	Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
[04:04.12]	Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
[04:07.30]	Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
[04:10.41]	Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
[04:13.07]	Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
[04:16.19]	When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
[04:19.43]	No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
[04:22.47]	For I shall never hold that man my friend
[04:25.52]	Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
[04:28.76]	To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
[04:31.24]HOTSPUR	Revolted Mortimer!
[04:32.76]	He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
[04:35.75]	But by the chance of war; to prove that true
[04:38.92]	Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
[04:42.48]	Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
[04:45.72]	When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
[04:48.58]	In single opposition, hand to hand,
[04:51.12]	He did confound the best part of an hour
[04:54.10]	In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
[04:57.21]	Three times they breathed and three times did
[05:00.51]	they drink,
[05:01.59]	Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
[05:04.45]	Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
[05:07.63]	Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
[05:10.55]	And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
[05:13.60]	Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
[05:16.71]	Never did base and rotten policy
[05:19.19]	Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
[05:22.30]	Nor could the noble Mortimer
[05:24.52]	Receive so many, and all willingly:
[05:27.06]	Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
[05:30.11]KING HENRY IV	Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
[05:33.41]	He never did encounter with Glendower:
[05:36.21]	I tell thee,
[05:37.35]	He durst as well have met the devil alone
[05:40.40]	As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
[05:42.75]	Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
[05:45.86]	Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
[05:48.65]	Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
[05:52.08]	Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
[05:55.07]	As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
[05:58.31]	We licence your departure with your son.
[06:01.23]	Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
[06:04.53]	[Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train]
[06:05.29]HOTSPUR	An if the devil come and roar for them,
[06:08.15]	I will not send them: I will after straight
[06:11.26]	And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
[06:14.25]	Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
[06:16.79]NORTHUMBERLAND	What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
[06:20.03]	Here comes your uncle.
[06:21.81]	[Re-enter WORCESTER]
[06:22.57]HOTSPUR	Speak of Mortimer!
[06:24.09]	'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
[06:27.20]	Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
[06:29.93]	Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
[06:33.05]	And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
[06:36.48]	But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
[06:39.33]	As high in the air as this unthankful king,
[06:42.45]	As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
[06:45.43]NORTHUMBERLAND	Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
[06:48.54]EARL OF WORCESTER	Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
[06:51.53]HOTSPUR	He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
[06:54.38]	And when I urged the ransom once again
[06:57.24]	Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
[07:00.67]	And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
[07:03.66]	Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
[07:06.51]EARL OF WORCESTER	I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
[07:09.50]	By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
[07:12.55]NORTHUMBERLAND	He was; I heard the proclamation:
[07:14.96]	And then it was when the unhappy king,
[07:17.76]	--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
[07:20.93]	Upon his Irish expedition;
[07:22.96]	From whence he intercepted did return
[07:25.76]	To be deposed and shortly murdered.
[07:28.36]EARL OF WORCESTER	And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
[07:31.85]	Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
[07:34.65]HOTSPUR	But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
[07:37.70]	Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
[07:40.36]	Heir to the crown?
[07:41.89]NORTHUMBERLAND	He did; myself did hear it.
[07:43.92]HOTSPUR	Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
[07:46.84]	That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
[07:50.21]	But shall it be that you, that set the crown
[07:53.38]	Upon the head of this forgetful man
[07:56.05]	And for his sake wear the detested blot
[07:58.97]	Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
[08:01.70]	That you a world of curses undergo,
[08:04.31]	Being the agents, or base second means,
[08:07.10]	The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
[08:10.21]	O, pardon me that I descend so low,
[08:12.75]	To show the line and the predicament
[08:15.48]	Wherein you range under this subtle king;
[08:18.47]	Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
[08:21.58]	Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
[08:24.38]	That men of your nobility and power
[08:27.04]	Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
[08:29.90]	As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
[08:32.76]	To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
[08:35.87]	An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
[08:39.05]	And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
[08:42.28]	That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
[08:45.46]	By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
[08:48.51]	No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
[08:51.56]	Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
[08:54.80]	Into the good thoughts of the world again,
[08:57.84]	Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
[09:00.96]	Of this proud king, who studies day and night
[09:04.19]	To answer all the debt he owes to you
[09:06.99]	Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
[09:10.16]	Therefore, I say--
[09:11.56]EARL OF WORCESTER	Peace, cousin, say no more:
[09:13.53]	And now I will unclasp a secret book,
[09:16.26]	And to your quick-conceiving discontents
[09:19.25]	I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
[09:22.17]	As full of peril and adventurous spirit
[09:25.09]	As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
[09:27.95]	On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
[09:30.74]HOTSPUR	If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
[09:33.73]	Send danger from the east unto the west,
[09:36.65]	So honour cross it from the north to south,
[09:39.76]	And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
[09:42.93]	To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
[09:45.67]NORTHUMBERLAND	Imagination of some great exploit
[09:48.21]	Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
[09:51.19]HOTSPUR	By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
[09:54.11]	To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
[09:57.54]	Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
[10:00.21]	Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
[10:03.57]	And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
[10:06.56]	So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
[10:09.80]	Without corrival, all her dignities:
[10:12.40]	But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
[10:15.32]EARL OF WORCESTER	He apprehends a world of figures here,
[10:18.12]	But not the form of what he should attend.
[10:21.17]	Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
[10:24.15]HOTSPUR	I cry you mercy.
[10:25.55]EARL OF WORCESTER	Those same noble Scots
[10:27.39]	That are your prisoners,--
[10:29.30]HOTSPUR	I'll keep them all;
[10:30.88]	By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
[10:33.80]	No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
[10:37.11]	I'll keep them, by this hand.
[10:39.27]EARL OF WORCESTER	You start away
[10:40.60]	And lend no ear unto my purposes.
[10:43.08]	Those prisoners you shall keep.
[10:45.43]HOTSPUR	Nay, I will; that's flat:
[10:47.27]	He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
[10:50.00]	Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
[10:52.79]	But I will find him when he lies asleep,
[10:55.72]	And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
[10:58.32]	Nay,
[10:58.95]	I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
[11:02.26]	Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
[11:04.99]	To keep his anger still in motion.
[11:07.53]EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear you, cousin; a word.
[11:09.37]HOTSPUR	All studies here I solemnly defy,
[11:11.85]	Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
[11:15.02]	And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
[11:18.45]	But that I think his father loves him not
[11:21.50]	And would be glad he met with some mischance,
[11:24.74]	I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
[11:27.91]EARL OF WORCESTER	Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
[11:30.45]	When you are better temper'd to attend.
[11:33.31]NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
[11:36.30]	Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
[11:39.28]	Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
[11:42.39]HOTSPUR	Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
[11:45.89]	Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
[11:49.06]	Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
[11:51.73]	In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
[11:54.97]	A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
[11:58.02]	'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
[12:01.06]	His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
[12:04.18]	Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
[12:07.23]	'Sblood!--
[12:08.05]	When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
[12:11.16]NORTHUMBERLAND	At Berkley castle.
[12:12.69]HOTSPUR	You say true:
[12:13.89]	Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
[12:16.43]	This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
[12:19.55]	Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
[12:22.53]	And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
[12:25.39]	O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
[12:28.69]	Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.
[12:31.49]EARL OF WORCESTER	Nay, if you have not, to it again;
[12:33.90]	We will stay your leisure.
[12:35.93]HOTSPUR	I have done, i' faith.
[12:37.58]EARL OF WORCESTER	Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
[12:40.63]	Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
[12:43.93]	And make the Douglas' son your only mean
[12:46.85]	For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
[12:50.28]	Which I shall send you written, be assured,
[12:53.33]	Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
[12:55.94]	[To Northumberland]
[12:56.70]	Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
[12:59.68]	Shall secretly into the bosom creep
[13:02.35]	Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
[13:05.27]	The archbishop.
[13:06.60]HOTSPUR	Of York, is it not?
[13:08.13]EARL OF WORCESTER	True; who bears hard
[13:09.78]	His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
[13:13.15]	I speak not this in estimation,
[13:15.50]	As what I think might be, but what I know
[13:18.48]	Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
[13:21.02]	And only stays but to behold the face
[13:23.82]	Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
[13:26.74]HOTSPUR	I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.
[13:29.66]NORTHUMBERLAND	Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.
[13:33.09]HOTSPUR	Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
[13:36.07]	And then the power of Scotland and of York,
[13:39.18]	To join with Mortimer, ha?
[13:41.15]EARL OF WORCESTER	And so they shall.
[13:42.68]HOTSPUR	In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
[13:45.47]EARL OF WORCESTER	And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
[13:48.33]	To save our heads by raising of a head;
[13:51.19]	For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
[13:53.92]	The king will always think him in our debt,
[13:57.03]	And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
[14:00.02]	Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
[14:03.00]	And see already how he doth begin
[14:05.54]	To make us strangers to his looks of love.
[14:08.59]HOTSPUR	He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.
[14:11.57]EARL OF WORCESTER	Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
[14:14.37]	Than I by letters shall direct your course.
[14:17.48]	When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
[14:20.46]	I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
[14:23.51]	Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
[14:26.75]	As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
[14:29.67]	To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
[14:32.85]	Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
[14:35.64]NORTHUMBERLAND	Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.
[14:38.95]HOTSPUR	Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
[14:41.68]	Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!
[14:45.30]	[Exeunt]
