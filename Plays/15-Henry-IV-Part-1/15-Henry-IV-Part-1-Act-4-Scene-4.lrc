[00:00.34]	[York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.,]
[00:01.03]	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL]
[00:01.72]ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
[00:04.60]	With winged haste to the lord marshal;
[00:07.13]	This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
[00:09.89]	To whom they are directed. If you knew
[00:12.42]	How much they do to import, you would make haste.
[00:15.52]SIR MICHAEL	My good lord,
[00:16.61]	I guess their tenor.
[00:18.11]ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Like enough you do.
[00:19.55]	To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
[00:21.96]	Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
[00:24.61]	Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
[00:27.37]	As I am truly given to understand,
[00:29.67]	The king with mighty and quick-raised power
[00:32.54]	Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
[00:35.47]	What with the sickness of Northumberland,
[00:38.18]	Whose power was in the first proportion,
[00:40.82]	And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
[00:43.81]	Who with them was a rated sinew too
[00:46.23]	And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
[00:48.99]	I fear the power of Percy is too weak
[00:51.52]	To wage an instant trial with the king.
[00:54.10]SIR MICHAEL	Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
[00:56.46]	There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
[00:58.82]ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	No, Mortimer is not there.
[01:00.60]SIR MICHAEL	But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
[01:03.53]	And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
[01:06.47]	Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
[01:08.88]ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
[01:11.76]	The special head of all the land together:
[01:14.52]	The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
[01:17.33]	The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
[01:20.04]	And moe corrivals and dear men
[01:22.16]	Of estimation and command in arms.
[01:24.46]SIR MICHAEL	Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
[01:27.40]ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
[01:29.98]	And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:
[01:32.80]	For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
[01:35.56]	Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
[01:38.15]	For he hath heard of our confederacy,
[01:40.62]	And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
[01:43.61]	Therefore make haste. I must go write again
[01:46.43]	To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.
[01:49.36]	[Exeunt]
