[00:00.39]	[Rochester. An inn yard.,]
[00:01.19]	[Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand]
[00:01.99]First Carrier	Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be
[00:05.44]	hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
[00:09.03]	yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!
[00:11.89]Ostler	[Within] Anon, anon.
[00:13.35]First Carrier	I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
[00:17.00]	in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
[00:20.79]	of all cess.
[00:21.98]	[Enter another Carrier]
[00:22.78]Second Carrier	Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
[00:26.50]	is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
[00:30.15]	house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
[00:34.01]First Carrier	Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
[00:37.60]	rose; it was the death of him.
[00:39.92]Second Carrier	I think this be the most villanous house in all
[00:43.51]	London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
[00:46.96]First Carrier	Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king
[00:50.48]	christen could be better bit than I have been since
[00:54.34]	the first cock.
[00:55.73]Second Carrier	Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we
[00:59.45]	leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds
[01:03.10]	fleas like a loach.
[01:04.77]First Carrier	What, ostler! come away and be hanged!
[01:07.56]Second Carrier	I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
[01:11.28]	to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
[01:14.33]First Carrier	God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
[01:17.85]	starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
[01:21.37]	never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
[01:24.63]	'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate
[01:28.35]	on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!
[01:31.87]	hast thou no faith in thee?
[01:34.06]	[Enter GADSHILL]
[01:34.86]GADSHILL	Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?
[01:37.65]First Carrier	I think it be two o'clock.
[01:39.77]GADSHILL	I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
[01:43.49]	in the stable.
[01:44.82]First Carrier	Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.
[01:49.01]GADSHILL	I pray thee, lend me thine.
[01:51.13]Second Carrier	Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
[01:54.59]	he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.
[01:57.38]GADSHILL	Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
[02:01.43]Second Carrier	Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
[02:05.09]	thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
[02:08.34]	gentleman: they will along with company, for they
[02:11.93]	have great charge.
[02:13.52]	[Exeunt carriers]
[02:14.32]GADSHILL	What, ho! chamberlain!
[02:16.05]Chamberlain	[Within] At hand, quoth pick-purse.
[02:18.50]GADSHILL	That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the
[02:21.63]	chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking
[02:25.35]	of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;
[02:29.20]	thou layest the plot how.
[02:31.26]	[Enter Chamberlain]
[02:32.06]Chamberlain	Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
[02:35.78]	I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
[02:39.43]	wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
[02:43.22]	him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
[02:46.67]	company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
[02:50.46]	that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
[02:54.11]	They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
[02:57.77]	they will away presently.
[02:59.82]GADSHILL	Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
[03:03.15]	clerks, I'll give thee this neck.
[03:05.67]Chamberlain	No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
[03:09.32]	hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
[03:12.91]	as truly as a man of falsehood may.
[03:15.64]GADSHILL	What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
[03:19.29]	I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
[03:23.01]	Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
[03:26.66]	starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
[03:30.32]	dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
[03:33.70]	content to do the profession some grace; that would,
[03:37.49]	if matters should be looked into, for their own
[03:41.01]	credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
[03:44.53]	foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
[03:48.19]	none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
[03:51.97]	but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
[03:55.83]	great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
[03:59.35]	strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
[04:02.87]	drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
[04:06.45]	I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
[04:10.24]	commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
[04:13.83]	on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
[04:17.48]	her their boots.
[04:18.94]Chamberlain	What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
[04:22.53]	out water in foul way?
[04:24.39]GADSHILL	She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We
[04:27.91]	steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
[04:31.63]	of fern-seed, we walk invisible.
[04:34.09]Chamberlain	Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
[04:37.81]	the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
[04:41.86]GADSHILL	Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
[04:45.45]	purchase, as I am a true man.
[04:47.71]Chamberlain	Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
[04:51.50]GADSHILL	Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
[04:55.02]	ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
[04:58.80]	you muddy knave.
[05:00.26]	[Exeunt]
