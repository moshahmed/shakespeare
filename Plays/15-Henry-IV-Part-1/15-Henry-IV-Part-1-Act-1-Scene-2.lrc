[00:00.40]	[London. An apartment of the Prince's.,]
[00:01.22]	[Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF]
[00:02.04]FALSTAFF	Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
[00:04.84]PRINCE HENRY	Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
[00:08.59]	and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
[00:12.55]	benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
[00:16.16]	demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
[00:19.85]	What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
[00:23.67]	day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
[00:27.28]	capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
[00:31.31]	signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
[00:35.26]	a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
[00:39.22]	reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
[00:43.24]	the time of the day.
[00:45.02]FALSTAFF	Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
[00:48.77]	purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
[00:52.59]	by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
[00:56.27]	I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
[00:59.82]	save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
[01:03.37]	thou wilt have none,--
[01:05.14]PRINCE HENRY	What, none?
[01:06.23]FALSTAFF	No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
[01:09.64]	prologue to an egg and butter.
[01:12.10]PRINCE HENRY	Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
[01:14.90]FALSTAFF	Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
[01:18.58]	us that are squires of the night's body be called
[01:22.40]	thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
[01:25.95]	foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
[01:29.63]	moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
[01:33.45]	being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
[01:37.00]	chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
[01:41.36]PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
[01:44.98]	fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
[01:48.87]	flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
[01:52.48]	by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
[01:55.96]	most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
[01:59.78]	dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
[02:03.33]	swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
[02:06.94]	now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
[02:10.56]	and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
[02:15.06]FALSTAFF	By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
[02:18.68]	hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
[02:21.88]PRINCE HENRY	As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
[02:25.77]	is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
[02:29.59]FALSTAFF	How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
[02:33.14]	thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
[02:36.89]	buff jerkin?
[02:38.12]PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
[02:42.48]FALSTAFF	Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
[02:46.17]	time and oft.
[02:47.46]PRINCE HENRY	Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
[02:50.67]FALSTAFF	No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
[02:54.56]PRINCE HENRY	Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
[02:58.38]	and where it would not, I have used my credit.
[03:01.86]FALSTAFF	Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
[03:05.68]	that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
[03:09.36]	wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
[03:13.32]	thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
[03:17.14]	with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
[03:21.03]	not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
[03:24.23]PRINCE HENRY	No; thou shalt.
[03:25.60]FALSTAFF	Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
[03:29.35]PRINCE HENRY	Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
[03:33.17]	the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
[03:37.40]FALSTAFF	Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
[03:41.08]	humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
[03:44.90]	you.
[03:45.58]PRINCE HENRY	For obtaining of suits?
[03:47.56]FALSTAFF	Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
[03:51.18]	hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
[03:54.86]	as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
[03:57.32]PRINCE HENRY	Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
[03:59.98]FALSTAFF	Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
[04:03.32]PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
[04:07.00]	Moor-ditch?
[04:08.16]FALSTAFF	Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
[04:12.12]	the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
[04:15.60]	prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
[04:19.01]	with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
[04:22.90]	commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
[04:26.65]	lord of the council rated me the other day in the
[04:30.47]	street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
[04:34.29]	he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
[04:38.04]	yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
[04:41.38]PRINCE HENRY	Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
[04:44.79]	streets, and no man regards it.
[04:47.25]FALSTAFF	O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
[04:51.14]	to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
[04:54.89]	me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
[04:58.37]	thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
[05:01.92]	should speak truly, little better than one of the
[05:05.67]	wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
[05:09.49]	it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
[05:13.17]	I'll be damned for never a king's son in
[05:16.38]	Christendom.
[05:17.61]PRINCE HENRY	Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
[05:20.88]FALSTAFF	'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
[05:24.43]	do not, call me villain and baffle me.
[05:27.36]PRINCE HENRY	I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
[05:31.32]	to purse-taking.
[05:32.82]FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
[05:36.30]	man to labour in his vocation.
[05:38.75]	[Enter POINS]
[05:39.57]	Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
[05:43.19]	match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
[05:46.73]	hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
[05:50.49]	most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
[05:54.24]	a true man.
[05:55.40]PRINCE HENRY	Good morrow, Ned.
[05:56.90]POINS	Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
[06:00.65]	what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
[06:03.99]	agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
[06:07.88]	soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
[06:11.91]	and a cold capon's leg?
[06:13.88]PRINCE HENRY	Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
[06:17.64]	his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
[06:21.18]	proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
[06:24.32]POINS	Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
[06:28.62]PRINCE HENRY	Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
[06:32.23]POINS	But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
[06:35.78]	o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
[06:39.67]	to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
[06:43.22]	riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
[06:46.90]	for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
[06:50.24]	Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
[06:54.13]	supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
[06:57.88]	as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
[07:01.50]	your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
[07:05.25]	at home and be hanged.
[07:07.16]FALSTAFF	Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
[07:10.71]	I'll hang you for going.
[07:12.75]POINS	You will, chops?
[07:14.19]FALSTAFF	Hal, wilt thou make one?
[07:16.17]PRINCE HENRY	Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
[07:19.17]FALSTAFF	There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
[07:22.37]	fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
[07:26.33]	royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
[07:30.08]PRINCE HENRY	Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
[07:33.42]FALSTAFF	Why, that's well said.
[07:35.27]PRINCE HENRY	Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
[07:38.34]FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
[07:42.43]PRINCE HENRY	I care not.
[07:43.59]POINS	Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
[07:47.34]	I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
[07:51.30]	that he shall go.
[07:52.86]FALSTAFF	Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
[07:56.82]	the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
[08:00.64]	move and what he hears may be believed, that the
[08:04.33]	true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
[08:08.15]	thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
[08:11.49]	countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
[08:15.44]PRINCE HENRY	Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
[08:19.67]	[Exit Falstaff]
[08:20.49]POINS	Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
[08:23.77]	to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
[08:27.52]	manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
[08:31.27]	shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
[08:35.02]	yourself and I will not be there; and when they
[08:38.64]	have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
[08:42.32]	this head off from my shoulders.
[08:44.91]PRINCE HENRY	How shall we part with them in setting forth?
[08:48.39]POINS	Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
[08:52.01]	appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
[08:55.76]	our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
[08:59.58]	upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
[09:03.40]	no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
[09:06.74]PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
[09:10.36]	horses, by our habits and by every other
[09:13.50]	appointment, to be ourselves.
[09:15.82]POINS	Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
[09:19.50]	in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
[09:23.18]	leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
[09:26.73]	for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
[09:30.62]PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
[09:34.10]POINS	Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
[09:37.37]	true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
[09:41.19]	third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
[09:45.01]	forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
[09:48.83]	incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
[09:52.79]	tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
[09:56.27]	least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
[09:59.95]	extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
[10:03.77]	lies the jest.
[10:05.13]PRINCE HENRY	Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
[10:08.61]	necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
[10:12.50]	there I'll sup. Farewell.
[10:14.55]POINS	Farewell, my lord.
[10:16.12]	[Exit Poins]
[10:16.94]PRINCE HENRY	I know you all, and will awhile uphold
[10:19.94]	The unyoked humour of your idleness:
[10:22.80]	Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
[10:25.53]	Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
[10:28.87]	To smother up his beauty from the world,
[10:32.01]	That, when he please again to be himself,
[10:35.15]	Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
[10:38.29]	By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
[10:41.70]	Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
[10:44.90]	If all the year were playing holidays,
[10:47.91]	To sport would be as tedious as to work;
[10:51.04]	But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
[10:54.66]	And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
[10:57.80]	So, when this loose behavior I throw off
[11:00.94]	And pay the debt I never promised,
[11:03.66]	By how much better than my word I am,
[11:06.60]	By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
[11:09.67]	And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
[11:12.87]	My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
[11:16.01]	Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
[11:19.49]	Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
[11:22.83]	I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
[11:25.90]	Redeeming time when men think least I will.
[11:29.24]	[Exit]
