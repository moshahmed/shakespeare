[00:00.56]	[Another part of the field.,]
[00:01.68]	[Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN
[00:02.24]	+ OF LANCASTER, and EARL OF WESTMORELAND]
[00:02.80]KING HENRY IV	I prithee,
[00:04.29]	Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
[00:09.15]	Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
[00:13.35]LANCASTER	Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
[00:17.36]PRINCE HENRY	I beseech your majesty, make up,
[00:20.82]	Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
[00:25.40]KING HENRY IV	I will do so.
[00:27.17]	My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.
[00:31.93]WESTMORELAND	Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
[00:36.23]PRINCE HENRY	Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:
[00:40.52]	And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
[00:45.38]	The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
[00:50.24]	Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
[00:54.44]	and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
[00:58.45]LANCASTER	We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,
[01:03.22]	Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.
[01:07.79]	[Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND]
[01:08.91]PRINCE HENRY	By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
[01:13.12]	I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
[01:17.69]	Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
[01:21.80]	But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
[01:25.82]KING HENRY IV	I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
[01:30.02]	With lustier maintenance than I did look for
[01:34.78]	Of such an ungrown warrior.
[01:37.86]PRINCE HENRY	O, this boy
[01:39.45]	Lends mettle to us all!
[01:42.16]	[Exit]
[01:43.28]	[Enter DOUGLAS]
[01:44.40]EARL OF DOUGLAS	Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
[01:48.88]	I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
[01:52.80]	That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
[01:57.66]	That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
[02:02.05]KING HENRY IV	The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
[02:06.91]	So many of his shadows thou hast met
[02:10.92]	And not the very king. I have two boys
[02:15.03]	Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
[02:19.23]	But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
[02:23.62]	I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.
[02:27.54]EARL OF DOUGLAS	I fear thou art another counterfeit;
[02:31.47]	And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
[02:36.42]	But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
[02:41.09]	And thus I win thee.
[02:43.51]	[They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE
[02:44.07]	+ HENRY enters]
[02:44.63]PRINCE HENRY	Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
[02:49.30]	Never to hold it up again! the spirits
[02:53.41]	Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:
[02:58.55]	It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
[03:03.40]	Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
[03:07.70]	[They fight: DOUGLAS flies]
[03:08.82]	Cheerly, my lord
[03:10.88]	how fares your grace?
[03:13.40]	Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,
[03:17.79]	And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
[03:22.55]KING HENRY IV	Stay, and breathe awhile:
[03:25.35]	Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
[03:29.27]	And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
[03:34.13]	In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
[03:38.80]PRINCE HENRY	O God! they did me too much injury
[03:42.53]	That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
[03:47.02]	If it were so, I might have let alone
[03:51.03]	The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
[03:55.23]	Which would have been as speedy in your end
[03:59.90]	As all the poisonous potions in the world
[04:04.39]	And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
[04:09.15]KING HENRY IV	Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
[04:14.10]	[Exit]
[04:15.22]	[Enter HOTSPUR]
[04:16.34]HOTSPUR	If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
[04:20.73]PRINCE HENRY	Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
[04:25.12]HOTSPUR	My name is Harry Percy.
[04:27.83]PRINCE HENRY	Why, then I see
[04:29.79]	A very valiant rebel of the name.
[04:33.43]	I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
[04:38.19]	To share with me in glory any more:
[04:42.02]	Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
[04:46.88]	Nor can one England brook a double reign,
[04:51.26]	Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
[04:55.47]HOTSPUR	Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
[04:59.76]	To end the one of us; and would to God
[05:03.87]	Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
[05:08.45]PRINCE HENRY	I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
[05:12.93]	And all the budding honours on thy crest
[05:17.32]	I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
[05:21.62]HOTSPUR	I can no longer brook thy vanities.
[05:25.44]	[They fight]
[05:26.56]	[Enter FALSTAFF]
[05:27.69]FALSTAFF	Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
[05:32.54]	boy's play here, I can tell you.
[05:36.00]	[Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF,
[05:36.56]	+ who falls down as if he were dead, and exit
[05:37.12]	+ DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls]
[05:37.68]HOTSPUR	O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
[05:41.97]	I better brook the loss of brittle life
[05:46.27]	Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
[05:50.94]	They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
[05:56.07]	But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
[06:01.58]	And time, that takes survey of all the world,
[06:06.25]	Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
[06:10.18]	But that the earthy and cold hand of death
[06:14.75]	Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
[06:19.14]	And food for--
[06:20.92]	[Dies]
[06:22.04]PRINCE HENRY	For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
[06:27.17]	Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
[06:31.93]	When that this body did contain a spirit,
[06:36.32]	A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
[06:40.53]	But now two paces of the vilest earth
[06:44.64]	Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
[06:49.58]	Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
[06:53.60]	If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
[06:57.34]	I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
[07:01.72]	But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
[07:06.11]	And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
[07:10.50]	For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
[07:14.89]	Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
[07:19.75]	Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
[07:24.23]	But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
[07:27.97]	[He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground]
[07:29.09]	What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
[07:34.04]	Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
[07:38.43]	I could have better spared a better man:
[07:42.72]	O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
[07:46.74]	If I were much in love with vanity!
[07:50.57]	Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
[07:55.14]	Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
[07:59.34]	Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
[08:03.36]	Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
[08:07.47]	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]
[08:08.59]FALSTAFF	[Rising up] Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
[08:13.16]	I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
[08:18.21]	to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
[08:22.97]	that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
[08:28.48]	Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
[08:33.24]	is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
[08:37.63]	counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
[08:43.05]	but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
[08:47.72]	liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
[08:52.76]	perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
[08:57.80]	valour is discretion; in the which better part I
[09:02.85]	have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
[09:07.70]	gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
[09:12.37]	should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
[09:17.51]	afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
[09:22.27]	Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I
[09:27.50]	killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
[09:32.17]	Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
[09:37.21]	Therefore, sirrah,
[09:39.36]	[Stabbing him]
[09:40.48]	with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.
[09:46.08]	[Takes up HOTSPUR on his back]
[09:47.20]	[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER]
[09:48.32]PRINCE HENRY	Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
[09:53.46]	Thy maiden sword.
[09:55.61]LANCASTER	But, soft! whom have we here?
[09:58.69]	Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
[10:03.17]PRINCE HENRY	I did; I saw him dead,
[10:05.69]	Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
[10:10.18]	thou alive?
[10:11.76]	Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
[10:16.62]	I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
[10:21.20]	Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
[10:26.24]FALSTAFF	No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
[10:31.38]	be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
[10:36.89]	[Throwing the body down]
[10:38.01]	if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
[10:43.33]	him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
[10:48.75]	earl or duke, I can assure you.
[10:52.11]PRINCE HENRY	Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.
[10:56.78]FALSTAFF	Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
[11:01.82]	lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
[11:06.77]	and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
[11:11.91]	fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
[11:17.23]	believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
[11:22.18]	valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
[11:27.50]	it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
[11:32.36]	thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
[11:37.21]	'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
[11:42.26]LANCASTER	This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
[11:47.02]PRINCE HENRY	This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
[11:51.50]	Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
[11:56.08]	For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
[12:00.28]	I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
[12:04.95]	[A retreat is sounded]
[12:06.07]	The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
[12:10.64]	Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
[12:15.69]	To see what friends are living, who are dead.
[12:20.36]	[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER]
[12:21.48]FALSTAFF	I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
[12:26.05]	rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
[12:30.82]	I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
[12:35.95]	live cleanly as a nobleman should do.
[12:39.97]	[Exit]
