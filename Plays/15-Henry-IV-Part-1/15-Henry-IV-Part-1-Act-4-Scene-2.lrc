[00:00.43]	[A public road near Coventry.,]
[00:01.31]	[Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
[00:02.18]FALSTAFF	Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
[00:06.04]	bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
[00:09.97]	we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
[00:12.66]BARDOLPH	Will you give me money, captain?
[00:15.36]FALSTAFF	Lay out, lay out.
[00:16.96]BARDOLPH	This bottle makes an angel.
[00:19.36]FALSTAFF	An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
[00:23.44]	twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
[00:27.44]	my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
[00:30.86]BARDOLPH	I will, captain: farewell.
[00:33.05]	[Exit]
[00:33.92]FALSTAFF	If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
[00:37.92]	gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
[00:41.85]	I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
[00:45.64]	soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
[00:49.64]	none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
[00:53.72]	me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
[00:57.87]	twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
[01:02.02]	as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
[01:06.02]	fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
[01:10.03]	fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
[01:14.25]	toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
[01:18.33]	bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
[01:22.26]	their services; and now my whole charge consists of
[01:26.41]	ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
[01:30.05]	companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
[01:33.76]	painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
[01:37.84]	sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
[01:41.84]	discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
[01:45.55]	younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
[01:49.41]	trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
[01:53.27]	long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
[01:57.49]	an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
[02:01.43]	the rooms of them that have bought out their
[02:05.14]	services, that you would think that I had a hundred
[02:09.29]	and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
[02:13.07]	swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
[02:17.00]	fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
[02:21.23]	all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
[02:25.38]	hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
[02:29.38]	Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
[02:32.95]	villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
[02:37.17]	gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
[02:41.25]	prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
[02:45.18]	company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
[02:49.18]	together and thrown over the shoulders like an
[02:53.04]	herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
[02:57.19]	the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
[03:01.27]	the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
[03:05.34]	one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.
[03:09.06]	[Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND]
[03:09.93]PRINCE HENRY	How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!
[03:12.77]FALSTAFF	What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
[03:16.70]	in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
[03:20.56]	cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
[03:24.85]	at Shrewsbury.
[03:26.31]WESTMORELAND	Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
[03:30.10]	there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
[03:34.17]	The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
[03:38.18]	away all night.
[03:39.70]FALSTAFF	Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
[03:43.56]	steal cream.
[03:44.87]PRINCE HENRY	I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
[03:48.88]	already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
[03:52.81]	fellows are these that come after?
[03:55.72]FALSTAFF	Mine, Hal, mine.
[03:57.18]PRINCE HENRY	I did never see such pitiful rascals.
[04:00.31]FALSTAFF	Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
[04:04.31]	for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:
[04:08.24]	tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
[04:10.94]WESTMORELAND	Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor
[04:14.94]	and bare, too beggarly.
[04:16.98]FALSTAFF	'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
[04:21.06]	that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
[04:25.06]	learned that of me.
[04:26.88]PRINCE HENRY	No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
[04:30.96]	the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
[04:34.67]	already in the field.
[04:36.63]FALSTAFF	What, is the king encamped?
[04:38.96]WESTMORELAND	He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.
[04:42.68]FALSTAFF	Well,
[04:43.48]	To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
[04:48.06]	Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
[04:51.19]	[Exeunt]
