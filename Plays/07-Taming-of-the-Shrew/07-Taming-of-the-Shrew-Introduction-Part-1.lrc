[00:00.45]                [SCENE I	Before an alehouse on a heath.]
[00:03.16]	[Enter Hostess and SLY]
[00:04.06]SLY	I'll pheeze you, in faith.
[00:06.40]Hostess	A pair of stocks, you rogue!
[00:08.88]SLY	Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
[00:12.95]	the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
[00:17.09]	Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!
[00:21.53]Hostess	You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
[00:25.60]SLY	No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
[00:29.51]	bed, and warm thee.
[00:31.32]Hostess	I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
[00:34.56]	third--borough.
[00:36.06]	[Exit]
[00:36.97]SLY	Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
[00:41.11]	by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
[00:45.10]	and kindly.
[00:46.38]	[Falls asleep]
[00:47.28]	[Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train]
[00:48.19]Lord	Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
[00:52.03]	Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
[00:55.49]	And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
[00:59.48]	Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
[01:03.24]	At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
[01:06.78]	I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
[01:10.40]First Huntsman	Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
[01:13.56]	He cried upon it at the merest loss
[01:16.72]	And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
[01:20.64]	Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
[01:24.03]Lord	Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
[01:27.34]	I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
[01:30.65]	But sup them well and look unto them all:
[01:34.19]	To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
[01:37.13]First Huntsman	I will, my lord.
[01:38.71]Lord	What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
[01:42.93]Second Huntsman	He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
[01:46.99]	This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
[01:50.83]Lord	O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
[01:54.52]	Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
[01:58.66]	Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
[02:02.20]	What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
[02:05.82]	Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
[02:10.18]	A most delicious banquet by his bed,
[02:13.35]	And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
[02:17.11]	Would not the beggar then forget himself?
[02:20.65]First Huntsman	Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
[02:24.19]Second Huntsman	It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
[02:28.03]Lord	Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
[02:31.94]	Then take him up and manage well the jest:
[02:35.56]	Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
[02:38.95]	And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
[02:42.86]	Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
[02:46.63]	And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
[02:50.54]	Procure me music ready when he wakes,
[02:53.78]	To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
[02:57.09]	And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
[03:00.86]	And with a low submissive reverence
[03:04.02]	Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
[03:07.48]	Let one attend him with a silver basin
[03:10.87]	Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
[03:14.79]	Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
[03:18.33]	And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
[03:22.69]	Some one be ready with a costly suit
[03:25.93]	And ask him what apparel he will wear;
[03:29.25]	Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
[03:32.78]	And that his lady mourns at his disease:
[03:36.25]	Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
[03:39.64]	And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
[03:43.25]	For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
[03:46.41]	This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
[03:49.65]	It will be pastime passing excellent,
[03:52.89]	If it be husbanded with modesty.
[03:55.75]First Huntsman	My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
[03:59.51]	As he shall think by our true diligence
[04:02.98]	He is no less than what we say he is.
[04:06.22]Lord	Take him up gently and to bed with him;
[04:09.60]	And each one to his office when he wakes.
[04:13.14]	[Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds]
[04:14.05]	Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
[04:17.74]	[Exit Servingman]
[04:18.64]	Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
[04:22.03]	Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
[04:25.72]	[Re-enter Servingman]
[04:26.62]	How now! who is it?
[04:28.43]Servant	An't please your honour, players
[04:31.29]	That offer service to your lordship.
[04:34.45]Lord	Bid them come near.
[04:36.34]	[Enter Players]
[04:37.24]	Now, fellows, you are welcome.
[04:39.80]Players	We thank your honour.
[04:41.83]Lord	Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
[04:45.14]A Player	So please your lordship to accept our duty.
[04:48.83]Lord	With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
[04:52.37]	Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
[04:56.06]	'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
[04:59.90]	I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
[05:03.59]	Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
[05:07.13]A Player	I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
[05:10.67]Lord	'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
[05:13.98]	Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
[05:17.45]	The rather for I have some sport in hand
[05:20.99]	Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
[05:24.45]	There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
[05:28.21]	But I am doubtful of your modesties;
[05:31.38]	Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
[05:34.61]	For yet his honour never heard a play--
[05:37.93]	You break into some merry passion
[05:40.94]	And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
[05:44.25]	If you should smile he grows impatient.
[05:47.64]A Player	Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
[05:51.26]	Were he the veriest antic in the world.
[05:54.64]Lord	Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
[05:57.73]	And give them friendly welcome every one:
[06:01.27]	Let them want nothing that my house affords.
[06:05.03]	[Exit one with the Players]
[06:05.94]	Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
[06:09.18]	And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
[06:13.02]	That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
[06:17.08]	And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
[06:20.24]	Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
[06:23.71]	He bear himself with honourable action,
[06:27.10]	Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
[06:30.64]	Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
[06:33.95]	Such duty to the drunkard let him do
[06:37.19]	With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
[06:40.65]	And say 'What is't your honour will command,
[06:44.34]	Wherein your lady and your humble wife
[06:47.73]	May show her duty and make known her love?'
[06:51.34]	And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
[06:55.41]	And with declining head into his bosom,
[06:58.80]	Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
[07:02.11]	To see her noble lord restored to health,
[07:05.65]	Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
[07:09.34]	No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
[07:13.03]	And if the boy have not a woman's gift
[07:16.42]	To rain a shower of commanded tears,
[07:19.58]	An onion will do well for such a shift,
[07:22.97]	Which in a napkin being close convey'd
[07:26.36]	Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
[07:29.67]	See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
[07:33.89]	Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
[07:37.20]	[Exit a Servingman]
[07:38.10]	I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
[07:41.64]	Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
[07:45.03]	I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
[07:48.87]	And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
[07:53.09]	When they do homage to this simple peasant.
[07:56.78]	I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
[08:00.39]	May well abate the over-merry spleen
[08:03.63]	Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
[08:07.17]	[Exeunt]
