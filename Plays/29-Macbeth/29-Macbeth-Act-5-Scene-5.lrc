[00:00.51]	[Dunsinane. Within the castle.,]
[00:01.55]	[Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum
[00:02.06]	+ and colours]
[00:02.58]MACBETH	Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
[00:06.71]	The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
[00:11.45]	Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
[00:15.93]	Till famine and the ague eat them up:
[00:19.63]	Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
[00:24.62]	We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
[00:29.10]	And beat them backward home.
[00:32.03]	[A cry of women within]
[00:33.06]	What is that noise?
[00:35.22]SEYTON	It is the cry of women, my good lord.
[00:38.83]	[Exit]
[00:39.87]MACBETH	I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
[00:43.83]	The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
[00:48.31]	To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
[00:52.53]	Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
[00:56.66]	As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
[01:01.48]	Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
[01:05.96]	Cannot once start me.
[01:08.29]	[Re-enter SEYTON]
[01:09.32]	Wherefore was that cry?
[01:11.82]SEYTON	The queen, my lord, is dead.
[01:14.57]MACBETH	She should have died hereafter;
[01:17.76]	There would have been a time for such a word.
[01:22.15]	To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
[01:25.94]	Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
[01:30.08]	To the last syllable of recorded time,
[01:33.86]	And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
[01:38.00]	The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
[01:42.30]	Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
[01:46.44]	That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
[01:50.92]	And then is heard no more: it is a tale
[01:54.79]	Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
[01:58.75]	Signifying nothing.
[02:00.91]	[Enter a Messenger]
[02:01.94]	Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
[02:06.59]Messenger	Gracious my lord,
[02:08.57]	I should report that which I say I saw,
[02:12.45]	But know not how to do it.
[02:15.20]MACBETH	Well, say, sir.
[02:16.84]Messenger	As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
[02:20.63]	I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
[02:24.76]	The wood began to move.
[02:27.26]MACBETH	Liar and slave!
[02:29.07]Messenger	Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
[02:33.03]	Within this three mile may you see it coming;
[02:37.42]	I say, a moving grove.
[02:39.75]MACBETH	If thou speak'st false,
[02:42.24]	Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
[02:46.29]	Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
[02:50.77]	I care not if thou dost for me as much.
[02:54.64]	I pull in resolution, and begin
[02:57.83]	To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
[03:01.71]	That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
[03:06.27]	Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
[03:09.89]	Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
[03:13.76]	If this which he avouches does appear,
[03:17.55]	There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
[03:21.86]	I gin to be aweary of the sun,
[03:24.96]	And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
[03:29.61]	Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
[03:33.74]	At least we'll die with harness on our back.
[03:38.05]	[Exeunt]
