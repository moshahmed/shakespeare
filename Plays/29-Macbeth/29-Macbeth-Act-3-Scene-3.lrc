[00:00.49]	[A park near the palace.,]
[00:01.48]	[Enter three Murderers]
[00:02.47]First Murderer	But who did bid thee join with us?
[00:05.77]Third Murderer	Macbeth.
[00:06.93]Second Murderer	He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
[00:11.05]	Our offices and what we have to do
[00:14.44]	To the direction just.
[00:16.75]First Murderer	Then stand with us.
[00:18.81]	The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
[00:23.19]	Now spurs the lated traveller apace
[00:26.65]	To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
[00:30.70]	The subject of our watch.
[00:33.25]Third Murderer	Hark! I hear horses.
[00:35.32]BANQUO	[Within] Give us a light there, ho!
[00:38.37]Second Murderer	Then 'tis he: the rest
[00:40.60]	That are within the note of expectation
[00:44.40]	Already are i' the court.
[00:46.87]First Murderer	His horses go about.
[00:49.02]Third Murderer	Almost a mile: but he does usually,
[00:52.32]	So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
[00:56.44]	Make it their walk.
[00:58.51]Second Murderer	A light, a light!
[01:00.32]	[Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch]
[01:01.31]Third Murderer	'Tis he.
[01:02.39]First Murderer	Stand to't.
[01:03.79]BANQUO	It will be rain to-night.
[01:06.35]First Murderer	Let it come down.
[01:08.25]	[They set upon BANQUO]
[01:09.24]BANQUO	O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
[01:13.12]	Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
[01:15.84]	[Dies. FLEANCE escapes]
[01:16.83]Third Murderer	Who did strike out the light?
[01:19.72]First Murderer	Wast not the way?
[01:21.62]Third Murderer	There's but one down; the son is fled.
[01:25.16]Second Murderer	We have lost
[01:26.73]	Best half of our affair.
[01:29.21]First Murderer	Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
[01:33.09]	[Exeunt]
