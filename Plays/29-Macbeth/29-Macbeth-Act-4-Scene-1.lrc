[00:00.61]	[A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.,]
[00:01.83]	[Thunder. Enter the three Witches]
[00:03.05]First Witch	Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
[00:07.13]Second Witch	Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
[00:11.51]Third Witch	Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.
[00:15.38]First Witch	Round about the cauldron go;
[00:18.84]	In the poison'd entrails throw.
[00:22.61]	Toad, that under cold stone
[00:25.97]	Days and nights has thirty-one
[00:29.74]	Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
[00:33.31]	Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
[00:37.38]ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;
[00:41.15]	Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
[00:44.82]Second Witch	Fillet of a fenny snake,
[00:47.88]	In the cauldron boil and bake;
[00:51.55]	Eye of newt and toe of frog,
[00:55.01]	Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
[00:58.68]	Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
[01:02.96]	Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
[01:06.62]	For a charm of powerful trouble,
[01:10.50]	Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
[01:14.57]ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;
[01:18.34]	Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
[01:22.01]Third Witch	Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
[01:25.68]	Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
[01:29.04]	Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
[01:32.71]	Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
[01:36.78]	Liver of blaspheming Jew,
[01:39.94]	Gall of goat, and slips of yew
[01:43.61]	Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
[01:47.38]	Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
[01:51.15]	Finger of birth-strangled babe
[01:54.92]	Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
[01:58.18]	Make the gruel thick and slab:
[02:01.84]	Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
[02:05.61]	For the ingredients of our cauldron.
[02:09.89]ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;
[02:13.66]	Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
[02:17.33]Second Witch	Cool it with a baboon's blood,
[02:21.00]	Then the charm is firm and good.
[02:24.87]	[Enter HECATE to the other three Witches]
[02:26.09]HECATE	O well done! I commend your pains;
[02:30.06]	And every one shall share i' the gains;
[02:34.55]	And now about the cauldron sing,
[02:38.42]	Live elves and fairies in a ring,
[02:42.39]	Enchanting all that you put in.
[02:46.16]	[Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' &c]
[02:47.38]	[HECATE retires]
[02:48.61]Second Witch	By the pricking of my thumbs,
[02:52.17]	Something wicked this way comes.
[02:56.04]	Open, locks,
[02:57.78]	Whoever knocks!
[02:59.91]	[Enter MACBETH]
[03:01.14]MACBETH	How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
[03:06.13]	What is't you do?
[03:08.47]ALL	A deed without a name.
[03:11.33]MACBETH	I conjure you, by that which you profess,
[03:16.01]	Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
[03:20.49]	Though you untie the winds and let them fight
[03:25.79]	Against the churches; though the yesty waves
[03:30.89]	Confound and swallow navigation up;
[03:35.06]	Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
[03:40.77]	Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
[03:45.96]	Though palaces and pyramids do slope
[03:50.35]	Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
[03:56.36]	Of nature's germens tumble all together,
[04:01.04]	Even till destruction sicken; answer me
[04:05.63]	To what I ask you.
[04:08.07]First Witch	Speak.
[04:09.29]Second Witch	Demand.
[04:10.62]Third Witch	We'll answer.
[04:12.55]First Witch	Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
[04:17.95]	Or from our masters?
[04:20.60]MACBETH	Call 'em; let me see 'em.
[04:23.46]First Witch	Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
[04:27.73]	Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
[04:32.22]	From the murderer's gibbet throw
[04:36.19]	Into the flame.
[04:38.33]ALL	Come, high or low;
[04:40.67]	Thyself and office deftly show!
[04:44.44]	[Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head]
[04:45.67]MACBETH	Tell me, thou unknown power,--
[04:49.03]First Witch	He knows thy thought:
[04:51.78]	Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
[04:56.06]First Apparition	Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
[05:00.64]	Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
[05:05.63]	[Descends]
[05:06.86]MACBETH	Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
[05:12.15]	Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
[05:16.84]	word more,--
[05:18.47]First Witch	He will not be commanded: here's another,
[05:23.16]	More potent than the first.
[05:26.52]	[Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child]
[05:27.74]Second Apparition	Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
[05:30.80]MACBETH	Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.
[05:34.67]Second Apparition	Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
[05:39.66]	The power of man, for none of woman born
[05:44.35]	Shall harm Macbeth.
[05:46.90]	[Descends]
[05:48.12]MACBETH	Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
[05:53.11]	But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
[05:57.80]	And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
[06:02.89]	That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
[06:07.78]	And sleep in spite of thunder.
[06:11.45]	[Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned,
[06:12.06]	+ with a tree in his hand]
[06:12.67]	What is this
[06:14.61]	That rises like the issue of a king,
[06:18.89]	And wears upon his baby-brow the round
[06:23.47]	And top of sovereignty?
[06:26.42]ALL	Listen, but speak not to't.
[06:29.69]Third Apparition	Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
[06:34.27]	Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
[06:39.47]	Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
[06:44.15]	Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
[06:48.94]	Shall come against him.
[06:51.89]	[Descends]
[06:53.12]MACBETH	That will never be
[06:55.66]	Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
[07:00.35]	Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
[07:05.85]	Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
[07:10.74]	Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
[07:15.73]	Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
[07:21.03]	To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
[07:25.62]	Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
[07:30.81]	Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
[07:35.81]	Reign in this kingdom?
[07:38.66]ALL	Seek to know no more.
[07:41.41]MACBETH	I will be satisfied: deny me this,
[07:45.38]	And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
[07:50.58]	Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
[07:55.98]	[Hautboys]
[07:57.20]First Witch	Show!
[07:58.32]Second Witch	Show!
[07:59.44]Third Witch	Show!
[08:00.56]ALL	Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
[08:04.74]	Come like shadows, so depart!
[08:08.20]	[A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in
[08:08.81]	+ his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following]
[08:09.43]MACBETH	Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
[08:14.52]	Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
[08:20.02]	Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
[08:25.22]	A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
[08:29.80]	Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
[08:34.90]	What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
[08:40.80]	Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
[08:45.39]	And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
[08:50.58]	Which shows me many more; and some I see
[08:55.27]	That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
[09:00.57]	Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
[09:04.64]	For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
[09:09.84]	And points at them for his.
[09:13.20]	[Apparitions vanish]
[09:14.42]	What, is this so?
[09:16.67]First Witch	Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
[09:20.33]	Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
[09:23.90]	Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
[09:28.28]	And show the best of our delights:
[09:32.36]	I'll charm the air to give a sound,
[09:36.53]	While you perform your antic round:
[09:40.71]	That this great king may kindly say,
[09:44.99]	Our duties did his welcome pay.
[09:48.76]	[Music. The witches dance and then vanish,
[09:49.37]	+ with HECATE]
[09:49.98]MACBETH	Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
[09:55.18]	Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
[09:59.35]	Come in, without there!
[10:02.21]	[Enter LENNOX]
[10:03.43]LENNOX	What's your grace's will?
[10:06.59]MACBETH	Saw you the weird sisters?
[10:09.85]LENNOX	No, my lord.
[10:11.58]MACBETH	Came they not by you?
[10:14.33]LENNOX	No, indeed, my lord.
[10:16.78]MACBETH	Infected be the air whereon they ride;
[10:21.26]	And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
[10:26.76]	The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
[10:31.55]LENNOX	'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
[10:36.74]	Macduff is fled to England.
[10:40.11]MACBETH	Fled to England!
[10:42.35]LENNOX	Ay, my good lord.
[10:44.59]MACBETH	Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
[10:49.38]	The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
[10:53.86]	Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
[10:58.95]	The very firstlings of my heart shall be
[11:03.74]	The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
[11:08.33]	To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
[11:14.44]	The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
[11:18.92]	Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
[11:24.12]	His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
[11:29.31]	That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
[11:35.12]	This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
[11:40.11]	But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
[11:45.31]	Come, bring me where they are.
[11:48.87]	[Exeunt]
