[00:00.46]	[The same.,]
[00:01.39]	[Knocking within. Enter a Porter]
[00:02.32]Porter	Here's a knocking indeed! If a
[00:05.11]	man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
[00:08.99]	old turning the key.
[00:11.01]	[Knocking within]
[00:11.94]	Knock,
[00:12.87]	knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
[00:16.29]	Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
[00:19.70]	himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
[00:23.66]	time; have napkins enow about you; here
[00:27.07]	you'll sweat for't.
[00:29.01]	[Knocking within]
[00:29.94]	Knock,
[00:30.87]	knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
[00:34.36]	name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
[00:38.24]	swear in both the scales against either scale;
[00:42.27]	who committed treason enough for God's sake,
[00:46.15]	yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
[00:49.88]	in, equivocator.
[00:51.50]	[Knocking within]
[00:52.44]	Knock,
[00:53.37]	knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
[00:56.93]	English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
[01:01.05]	a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
[01:04.77]	roast your goose.
[01:06.55]	[Knocking within]
[01:07.48]	Knock,
[01:08.42]	knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
[01:11.83]	this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
[01:16.17]	it no further: I had thought to have let in
[01:19.97]	some of all professions that go the primrose
[01:23.93]	way to the everlasting bonfire.
[01:26.80]	[Knocking within]
[01:27.73]	Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.
[01:31.38]	[Opens the gate]
[01:32.31]	[Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX]
[01:33.24]MACDUFF	Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
[01:36.96]	That you do lie so late?
[01:39.29]Porter	'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
[01:42.63]	second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
[01:45.96]	provoker of three things.
[01:48.37]MACDUFF	What three things does drink especially provoke?
[01:52.56]Porter	Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
[01:55.66]	urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
[01:59.62]	it provokes the desire, but it takes
[02:02.87]	away the performance: therefore, much drink
[02:06.60]	may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
[02:10.63]	it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
[02:13.97]	him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
[02:17.92]	and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
[02:21.72]	not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
[02:25.52]	in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
[02:29.48]MACDUFF	I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
[02:33.44]Porter	That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
[02:36.77]	me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
[02:40.34]	think, being too strong for him, though he took
[02:44.38]	up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
[02:48.49]	him.
[02:49.26]MACDUFF	Is thy master stirring?
[02:51.51]	[Enter MACBETH]
[02:52.44]	Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
[02:56.17]LENNOX	Good morrow, noble sir.
[02:58.34]MACBETH	Good morrow, both.
[03:00.12]MACDUFF	Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
[03:03.23]MACBETH	Not yet.
[03:04.31]MACDUFF	He did command me to call timely on him:
[03:07.88]	I have almost slipp'd the hour.
[03:10.75]MACBETH	I'll bring you to him.
[03:12.92]MACDUFF	I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
[03:16.41]	But yet 'tis one.
[03:18.12]MACBETH	The labour we delight in physics pain.
[03:21.53]	This is the door.
[03:23.32]MACDUFF	I'll make so bold to call,
[03:25.80]	For 'tis my limited service.
[03:28.36]	[Exit]
[03:29.29]LENNOX	Goes the king hence to-day?
[03:31.85]MACBETH	He does: he did appoint so.
[03:34.33]LENNOX	The night has been unruly: where we lay,
[03:37.82]	Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
[03:41.78]	Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
[03:46.28]	And prophesying with accents terrible
[03:49.69]	Of dire combustion and confused events
[03:53.18]	New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
[03:57.37]	Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
[04:01.56]	Was feverous and did shake.
[04:04.12]MACBETH	'Twas a rough night.
[04:06.06]LENNOX	My young remembrance cannot parallel
[04:09.40]	A fellow to it.
[04:11.03]	[Re-enter MACDUFF]
[04:11.96]MACDUFF	O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
[04:15.53]	Cannot conceive nor name thee!
[04:18.32]MACBETH	|
[04:18.78]	|	What's the matter.
[04:20.65]LENNOX	|
[04:21.11]MACDUFF	Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
[04:24.68]	Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
[04:28.25]	The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
[04:32.13]	The life o' the building!
[04:34.45]MACBETH	What is 't you say? the life?
[04:37.01]LENNOX	Mean you his majesty?
[04:39.11]MACDUFF	Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
[04:42.99]	With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
[04:46.40]	See, and then speak yourselves.
[04:49.19]	[Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX]
[04:50.12]	Awake, awake!
[04:51.52]	Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
[04:55.09]	Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
[04:58.27]	Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
[05:02.38]	And look on death itself! up, up, and see
[05:05.87]	The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
[05:09.28]	As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
[05:13.63]	To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
[05:17.28]	[Bell rings]
[05:18.21]	[Enter LADY MACBETH]
[05:19.14]LADY MACBETH	What's the business,
[05:21.15]	That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
[05:25.03]	The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
[05:28.45]MACDUFF	O gentle lady,
[05:30.00]	'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
[05:33.64]	The repetition, in a woman's ear,
[05:36.59]	Would murder as it fell.
[05:38.92]	[Enter BANQUO]
[05:39.85]	O Banquo, Banquo,
[05:41.56]	Our royal master 's murder'd!
[05:44.19]LADY MACBETH	Woe, alas!
[05:45.36]	What, in our house?
[05:47.22]BANQUO	Too cruel any where.
[05:49.24]	Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
[05:52.73]	And say it is not so.
[05:54.82]	[Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS]
[05:55.75]MACBETH	Had I but died an hour before this chance,
[05:59.48]	I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
[06:03.74]	There 's nothing serious in mortality:
[06:07.08]	All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
[06:10.72]	The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
[06:14.60]	Is left this vault to brag of.
[06:17.40]	[Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN]
[06:18.33]DONALBAIN	What is amiss?
[06:19.88]MACBETH	You are, and do not know't:
[06:22.36]	The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
[06:26.47]	Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
[06:30.35]MACDUFF	Your royal father 's murder'd.
[06:33.07]MALCOLM	O, by whom?
[06:34.31]LENNOX	Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
[06:38.26]	Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
[06:42.45]	So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
[06:46.41]	Upon their pillows:
[06:48.35]	They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
[06:52.38]	Was to be trusted with them.
[06:55.02]MACBETH	O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
[06:57.97]	That I did kill them.
[07:00.06]MACDUFF	Wherefore did you so?
[07:02.16]MACBETH	Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
[07:06.11]	Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
[07:09.45]	The expedition my violent love
[07:12.32]	Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
[07:15.96]	His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
[07:19.84]	And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
[07:24.34]	For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
[07:28.61]	Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
[07:33.11]	Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
[07:37.30]	That had a heart to love, and in that heart
[07:41.10]	Courage to make 's love known?
[07:43.81]LADY MACBETH	Help me hence, ho!
[07:45.60]MACDUFF	Look to the lady.
[07:47.38]MALCOLM	[Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,
[07:50.41]	That most may claim this argument for ours?
[07:54.21]DONALBAIN	[Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,
[07:57.23]	where our fate,
[07:58.86]	Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
[08:02.66]	Let 's away;
[08:03.98]	Our tears are not yet brew'd.
[08:06.70]MALCOLM	[Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow
[08:09.34]	Upon the foot of motion.
[08:11.66]BANQUO	Look to the lady:
[08:13.45]	[LADY MACBETH is carried out]
[08:14.38]	And when we have our naked frailties hid,
[08:18.02]	That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
[08:21.28]	And question this most bloody piece of work,
[08:25.16]	To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
[08:29.27]	In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
[08:33.15]	Against the undivulged pretence I fight
[08:36.72]	Of treasonous malice.
[08:38.81]MACDUFF	And so do I.
[08:40.21]ALL	So all.
[08:41.22]MACBETH	Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
[08:44.55]	And meet i' the hall together.
[08:47.27]ALL	Well contented.
[08:48.90]	[Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.]
[08:49.83]MALCOLM	What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
[08:53.79]	To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
[08:57.20]	Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
[09:01.23]DONALBAIN	To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
[09:04.41]	Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
[09:08.14]	There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
[09:12.48]	The nearer bloody.
[09:14.34]MALCOLM	This murderous shaft that's shot
[09:17.37]	Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
[09:20.94]	Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
[09:24.43]	And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
[09:28.07]	But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
[09:32.03]	Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.
[09:36.14]	[Exeunt]
