[00:00.46]	[Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.,]
[00:01.39]	[Enter BRUTUS]
[00:02.32]BRUTUS	What, Lucius, ho!
[00:03.94]	I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
[00:07.35]	Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
[00:10.91]	I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
[00:14.85]	When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
[00:18.49]	[Enter LUCIUS]
[00:19.42]LUCIUS	Call'd you, my lord?
[00:21.35]BRUTUS	Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
[00:24.45]	When it is lighted, come and call me here.
[00:28.09]LUCIUS	I will, my lord.
[00:29.71]	[Exit]
[00:30.64]BRUTUS	It must be by his death: and for my part,
[00:34.20]	I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
[00:37.84]	But for the general. He would be crown'd:
[00:41.40]	How that might change his nature, there's the question.
[00:46.04]	It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
[00:50.30]	And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
[00:54.17]	And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
[00:57.65]	That at his will he may do danger with.
[01:01.13]	The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
[01:04.92]	Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
[01:09.10]	I have not known when his affections sway'd
[01:12.97]	More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
[01:16.84]	That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
[01:20.56]	Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
[01:24.27]	But when he once attains the upmost round.
[01:27.98]	He then unto the ladder turns his back,
[01:31.47]	Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
[01:35.49]	By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
[01:38.82]	Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
[01:42.92]	Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
[01:46.48]	Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
[01:50.19]	Would run to these and these extremities:
[01:53.83]	And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
[01:57.62]	Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
[02:01.88]	And kill him in the shell.
[02:04.36]	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
[02:05.29]LUCIUS	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
[02:08.61]	Searching the window for a flint, I found
[02:12.25]	This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
[02:15.81]	It did not lie there when I went to bed.
[02:19.37]	[Gives him the letter]
[02:20.30]BRUTUS	Get you to bed again; it is not day.
[02:23.47]	Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
[02:26.95]LUCIUS	I know not, sir.
[02:28.58]BRUTUS	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
[02:32.06]LUCIUS	I will, sir.
[02:33.38]	[Exit]
[02:34.31]BRUTUS	The exhalations whizzing in the air
[02:37.56]	Give so much light that I may read by them.
[02:41.35]	[Opens the letter and reads]
[02:42.28]	'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
[02:46.07]	Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!
[02:49.16]	Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
[02:51.72]	Such instigations have been often dropp'd
[02:55.43]	Where I have took them up.
[02:57.91]	'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out:
[03:01.31]	Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
[03:05.42]	My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
[03:09.13]	The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
[03:13.00]	'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
[03:16.25]	To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
[03:20.35]	If the redress will follow, thou receivest
[03:24.07]	Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
[03:27.63]	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
[03:28.55]LUCIUS	Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
[03:31.65]	[Knocking within]
[03:32.58]BRUTUS	'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
[03:36.14]	[Exit LUCIUS]
[03:37.07]	Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
[03:41.17]	I have not slept.
[03:42.95]	Between the acting of a dreadful thing
[03:46.43]	And the first motion, all the interim is
[03:49.99]	Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
[03:53.24]	The Genius and the mortal instruments
[03:56.65]	Are then in council; and the state of man,
[04:00.28]	Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
[04:03.69]	The nature of an insurrection.
[04:06.47]	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
[04:07.40]LUCIUS	Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
[04:11.04]	Who doth desire to see you.
[04:13.59]BRUTUS	Is he alone?
[04:14.99]LUCIUS	No, sir, there are moe with him.
[04:17.77]BRUTUS	Do you know them?
[04:19.55]LUCIUS	No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
[04:23.65]	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
[04:27.52]	That by no means I may discover them
[04:30.85]	By any mark of favour.
[04:33.02]BRUTUS	Let 'em enter.
[04:34.49]	[Exit LUCIUS]
[04:35.42]	They are the faction. O conspiracy,
[04:38.51]	Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
[04:42.77]	When evils are most free? O, then by day
[04:46.25]	Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
[04:49.97]	To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
[04:54.30]	Hide it in smiles and affability:
[04:57.32]	For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
[05:00.95]	Not Erebus itself were dim enough
[05:04.05]	To hide thee from prevention.
[05:06.76]	[Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS
[05:07.22]	+ BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS]
[05:07.69]CASSIUS	I think we are too bold upon your rest:
[05:11.17]	Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
[05:14.50]BRUTUS	I have been up this hour, awake all night.
[05:18.13]	Know I these men that come along with you?
[05:21.85]CASSIUS	Yes, every man of them, and no man here
[05:25.25]	But honours you; and every one doth wish
[05:28.81]	You had but that opinion of yourself
[05:32.14]	Which every noble Roman bears of you.
[05:35.47]	This is Trebonius.
[05:37.33]BRUTUS	He is welcome hither.
[05:39.42]CASSIUS	This, Decius Brutus.
[05:41.35]BRUTUS	He is welcome too.
[05:43.21]CASSIUS	This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
[05:47.31]BRUTUS	They are all welcome.
[05:49.40]	What watchful cares do interpose themselves
[05:53.27]	Betwixt your eyes and night?
[05:55.90]CASSIUS	Shall I entreat a word?
[05:58.14]	[BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper]
[05:59.07]DECIUS BRUTUS	Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
[06:03.17]CASCA	No.
[06:03.87]CINNA	O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
[06:07.43]	That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
[06:11.22]CASCA	You shall confess that you are both deceived.
[06:15.17]	Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
[06:18.73]	Which is a great way growing on the south,
[06:22.44]	Weighing the youthful season of the year.
[06:26.08]	Some two months hence up higher toward the north
[06:30.34]	He first presents his fire; and the high east
[06:34.28]	Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
[06:37.53]BRUTUS	Give me your hands all over, one by one.
[06:41.02]CASSIUS	And let us swear our resolution.
[06:43.96]BRUTUS	No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
[06:47.36]	The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
[06:51.31]	If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
[06:55.10]	And every man hence to his idle bed;
[06:58.35]	So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
[07:01.68]	Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
[07:05.47]	As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
[07:08.88]	To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
[07:12.67]	The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
[07:16.61]	What need we any spur but our own cause,
[07:20.17]	To prick us to redress? what other bond
[07:23.66]	Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
[07:27.53]	And will not palter? and what other oath
[07:31.09]	Than honesty to honesty engaged,
[07:34.03]	That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
[07:37.74]	Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
[07:41.61]	Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
[07:45.56]	That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
[07:49.27]	Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
[07:53.22]	The even virtue of our enterprise,
[07:56.31]	Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
[08:00.18]	To think that or our cause or our performance
[08:04.21]	Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
[08:07.92]	That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
[08:11.41]	Is guilty of a several bastardy,
[08:14.35]	If he do break the smallest particle
[08:17.67]	Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
[08:21.31]CASSIUS	But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
[08:24.72]	I think he will stand very strong with us.
[08:28.43]CASCA	Let us not leave him out.
[08:30.83]CINNA	No, by no means.
[08:32.45]METELLUS CIMBER	O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
[08:35.94]	Will purchase us a good opinion
[08:38.88]	And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
[08:42.59]	It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
[08:46.62]	Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
[08:50.56]	But all be buried in his gravity.
[08:53.58]BRUTUS	O, name him not: let us not break with him;
[08:57.22]	For he will never follow any thing
[09:00.39]	That other men begin.
[09:02.48]CASSIUS	Then leave him out.
[09:04.42]CASCA	Indeed he is not fit.
[09:06.51]DECIUS BRUTUS	Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
[09:10.45]CASSIUS	Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
[09:14.09]	Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
[09:17.49]	Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
[09:21.29]	A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
[09:25.00]	If he improve them, may well stretch so far
[09:28.79]	As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
[09:32.04]	Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
[09:35.29]BRUTUS	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
[09:39.32]	To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
[09:43.19]	Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
[09:46.75]	For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
[09:49.92]	Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
[09:53.87]	We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
[09:57.81]	And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
[10:01.61]	O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
[10:05.55]	And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
[10:08.65]	Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
[10:12.52]	Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
[10:16.15]	Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
[10:19.95]	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
[10:23.51]	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
[10:27.07]	Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
[10:30.70]	And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
[10:34.49]	Our purpose necessary and not envious:
[10:37.90]	Which so appearing to the common eyes,
[10:41.30]	We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
[10:44.94]	And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
[10:48.27]	For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
[10:51.83]	When Caesar's head is off.
[10:54.31]CASSIUS	Yet I fear him;
[10:55.93]	For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
[10:59.88]BRUTUS	Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
[11:03.28]	If he love Caesar, all that he can do
[11:06.61]	Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
[11:10.63]	And that were much he should; for he is given
[11:14.58]	To sports, to wildness and much company.
[11:18.06]TREBONIUS	There is no fear in him; let him not die;
[11:21.62]	For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
[11:25.57]	[Clock strikes]
[11:26.50]BRUTUS	Peace! count the clock.
[11:28.67]CASSIUS	The clock hath stricken three.
[11:31.45]TREBONIUS	'Tis time to part.
[11:33.23]CASSIUS	But it is doubtful yet,
[11:35.48]	Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
[11:39.35]	For he is superstitious grown of late,
[11:42.75]	Quite from the main opinion he held once
[11:46.39]	Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
[11:49.64]	It may be, these apparent prodigies,
[11:52.81]	The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
[11:56.22]	And the persuasion of his augurers,
[11:59.39]	May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
[12:02.72]DECIUS BRUTUS	Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
[12:06.04]	I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
[12:09.60]	That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
[12:13.24]	And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
[12:17.11]	Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
[12:20.75]	But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
[12:24.31]	He says he does, being then most flattered.
[12:28.02]	Let me work;
[12:29.42]	For I can give his humour the true bent,
[12:32.97]	And I will bring him to the Capitol.
[12:36.23]CASSIUS	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
[12:40.09]BRUTUS	By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
[12:43.73]CINNA	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
[12:47.29]METELLUS CIMBER	Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
[12:50.62]	Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
[12:54.33]	I wonder none of you have thought of him.
[12:57.97]BRUTUS	Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
[13:01.07]	He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
[13:05.09]	Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
[13:08.73]CASSIUS	The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
[13:12.91]	And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
[13:17.16]	What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
[13:21.57]BRUTUS	Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
[13:24.98]	Let not our looks put on our purposes,
[13:28.38]	But bear it as our Roman actors do,
[13:31.56]	With untired spirits and formal constancy:
[13:35.27]	And so good morrow to you every one.
[13:38.52]	[Exeunt all but BRUTUS]
[13:39.45]	Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
[13:42.93]	Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
[13:46.26]	Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
[13:49.67]	Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
[13:53.46]	Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
[13:56.48]	[Enter PORTIA]
[13:57.40]PORTIA	Brutus, my lord!
[13:59.03]BRUTUS	Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
[14:02.90]	It is not for your health thus to commit
[14:06.54]	Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
[14:10.41]PORTIA	Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
[14:14.35]	Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
[14:18.22]	You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
[14:21.47]	Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
[14:25.11]	And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
[14:28.75]	You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
[14:32.23]	I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
[14:36.49]	And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
[14:40.28]	Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
[14:43.53]	But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
[14:47.01]	Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
[14:50.49]	Fearing to strengthen that impatience
[14:53.90]	Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
[14:57.69]	Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
[15:01.09]	Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
[15:04.96]	It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
[15:08.76]	And could it work so much upon your shape
[15:12.47]	As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
[15:16.34]	I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
[15:20.05]	Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
[15:23.92]BRUTUS	I am not well in health, and that is all.
[15:27.48]PORTIA	Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
[15:31.12]	He would embrace the means to come by it.
[15:34.76]BRUTUS	Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
[15:37.85]PORTIA	Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
[15:40.95]	To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
[15:44.59]	Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
[15:48.15]	And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
[15:51.94]	To dare the vile contagion of the night
[15:55.50]	And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
[15:58.90]	To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
[16:02.31]	You have some sick offence within your mind,
[16:06.18]	Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
[16:09.89]	I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
[16:13.22]	I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
[16:16.78]	By all your vows of love and that great vow
[16:20.65]	Which did incorporate and make us one,
[16:24.05]	That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
[16:27.69]	Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
[16:31.25]	Have had to resort to you: for here have been
[16:35.20]	Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
[16:38.99]	Even from darkness.
[16:40.92]BRUTUS	Kneel not, gentle Portia.
[16:43.25]PORTIA	I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
[16:47.12]	Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
[16:50.91]	Is it excepted I should know no secrets
[16:54.47]	That appertain to you? Am I yourself
[16:57.72]	But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
[17:01.05]	To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
[17:04.84]	And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
[17:09.40]	Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
[17:12.89]	Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
[17:16.21]BRUTUS	You are my true and honourable wife,
[17:19.46]	As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
[17:22.79]	That visit my sad heart
[17:25.11]PORTIA	If this were true, then should I know this secret.
[17:29.37]	I grant I am a woman; but withal
[17:32.31]	A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
[17:35.71]	I grant I am a woman; but withal
[17:38.66]	A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
[17:41.98]	Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
[17:45.47]	Being so father'd and so husbanded?
[17:48.64]	Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
[17:52.59]	I have made strong proof of my constancy,
[17:56.22]	Giving myself a voluntary wound
[17:59.16]	Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
[18:03.34]	And not my husband's secrets?
[18:06.05]BRUTUS	O ye gods,
[18:07.29]	Render me worthy of this noble wife!
[18:10.54]	[Knocking within]
[18:11.47]	Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
[18:15.10]	And by and by thy bosom shall partake
[18:18.51]	The secrets of my heart.
[18:20.83]	All my engagements I will construe to thee,
[18:24.62]	All the charactery of my sad brows:
[18:27.80]	Leave me with haste.
[18:29.81]	[Exit PORTIA]
[18:30.74]	Lucius, who's that knocks?
[18:33.14]	[Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS]
[18:34.06]LUCIUS	He is a sick man that would speak with you.
[18:37.86]BRUTUS	Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
[18:41.26]	Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
[18:44.43]LIGARIUS	Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
[18:48.23]BRUTUS	O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
[18:52.17]	To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
[18:55.97]LIGARIUS	I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
[18:59.29]	Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
[19:02.70]BRUTUS	Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
[19:06.26]	Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
[19:09.66]LIGARIUS	By all the gods that Romans bow before,
[19:13.15]	I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
[19:16.71]	Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
[19:20.27]	Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
[19:23.75]	My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
[19:26.92]	And I will strive with things impossible;
[19:30.56]	Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
[19:34.12]BRUTUS	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
[19:38.14]LIGARIUS	But are not some whole that we must make sick?
[19:42.17]BRUTUS	That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
[19:45.57]	I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
[19:49.05]	To whom it must be done.
[19:51.37]LIGARIUS	Set on your foot,
[19:53.15]	And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
[19:56.71]	To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
[20:00.20]	That Brutus leads me on.
[20:02.52]BRUTUS	Follow me, then.
[20:04.14]	[Exeunt]
