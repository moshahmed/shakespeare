[00:00.43]	[Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.,]
[00:01.30]	[Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS]
[00:02.17]PORTIA	I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
[00:05.35]	Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
[00:08.68]	Why dost thou stay?
[00:10.48]LUCIUS	To know my errand, madam.
[00:12.65]PORTIA	I would have had thee there, and here again,
[00:16.20]	Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
[00:20.11]	O constancy, be strong upon my side,
[00:23.07]	Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
[00:26.83]	I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
[00:30.16]	How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
[00:33.56]	Art thou here yet?
[00:35.30]LUCIUS	Madam, what should I do?
[00:37.39]	Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
[00:40.43]	And so return to you, and nothing else?
[00:43.62]PORTIA	Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
[00:47.23]	For he went sickly forth: and take good note
[00:50.85]	What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
[00:54.39]	Hark, boy! what noise is that?
[00:56.85]LUCIUS	I hear none, madam.
[00:58.59]PORTIA	Prithee, listen well;
[01:00.47]	I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
[01:03.65]	And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
[01:06.98]LUCIUS	Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
[01:09.37]	[Enter the Soothsayer]
[01:10.24]PORTIA	Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
[01:13.85]Soothsayer	At mine own house, good lady.
[01:16.31]PORTIA	What is't o'clock?
[01:18.05]Soothsayer	About the ninth hour, lady.
[01:20.36]PORTIA	Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
[01:23.26]Soothsayer	Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
[01:26.29]	To see him pass on to the Capitol.
[01:29.19]PORTIA	Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
[01:32.81]Soothsayer	That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
[01:36.28]	To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
[01:39.46]	I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
[01:42.79]PORTIA	Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
[01:46.77]Soothsayer	None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
[01:51.03]	Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
[01:54.72]	The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
[01:58.34]	Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
[02:01.60]	Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
[02:04.92]	I'll get me to a place more void, and there
[02:08.47]	Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
[02:11.80]	[Exit]
[02:12.66]PORTIA	I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
[02:15.70]	The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
[02:18.38]	The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
[02:21.92]	Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
[02:25.32]	That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
[02:28.80]	Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
[02:31.91]	Say I am merry: come to me again,
[02:34.65]	And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
[02:38.20]	[Exeunt severally]
