[00:00.36]	[A house in Rome.,]
[00:01.10]	[ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table]
[00:01.84]ANTONY	These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.
[00:05.28]OCTAVIUS	Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
[00:08.48]LEPIDUS	I do consent--
[00:09.65]OCTAVIUS	Prick him down, Antony.
[00:11.37]LEPIDUS	Upon condition Publius shall not live,
[00:14.08]	Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
[00:16.72]ANTONY	He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
[00:19.92]	But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
[00:22.57]	Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
[00:25.70]	How to cut off some charge in legacies.
[00:28.47]LEPIDUS	What, shall I find you here?
[00:30.50]OCTAVIUS	Or here, or at the Capitol.
[00:32.47]	[Exit LEPIDUS]
[00:33.21]ANTONY	This is a slight unmeritable man,
[00:35.61]	Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
[00:38.25]	The three-fold world divided, he should stand
[00:41.39]	One of the three to share it?
[00:43.54]OCTAVIUS	So you thought him;
[00:45.08]	And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
[00:48.40]	In our black sentence and proscription.
[00:51.17]ANTONY	Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
[00:54.00]	And though we lay these honours on this man,
[00:57.07]	To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
[01:00.21]	He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
[01:03.35]	To groan and sweat under the business,
[01:06.05]	Either led or driven, as we point the way;
[01:08.94]	And having brought our treasure where we will,
[01:12.14]	Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
[01:15.22]	Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
[01:18.05]	And graze in commons.
[01:19.71]OCTAVIUS	You may do your will;
[01:21.37]	But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
[01:24.01]ANTONY	So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
[01:26.66]	I do appoint him store of provender:
[01:29.24]	It is a creature that I teach to fight,
[01:32.01]	To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
[01:34.53]	His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
[01:37.48]	And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
[01:40.07]	He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
[01:43.33]	A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
[01:46.15]	On abjects, orts and imitations,
[01:48.43]	Which, out of use and staled by other men,
[01:51.32]	Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
[01:53.97]	But as a property. And now, Octavius,
[01:56.49]	Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
[01:59.26]	Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
[02:02.45]	Therefore let our alliance be combined,
[02:05.22]	Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
[02:08.17]	And let us presently go sit in council,
[02:10.94]	How covert matters may be best disclosed,
[02:13.83]	And open perils surest answered.
[02:16.17]OCTAVIUS	Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
[02:18.81]	And bay'd about with many enemies;
[02:21.27]	And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
[02:24.60]	Millions of mischiefs.
[02:26.32]	[Exeunt]
