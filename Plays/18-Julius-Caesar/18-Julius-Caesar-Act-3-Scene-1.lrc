[00:00.45]	[Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.,]
[00:01.37]	[A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the
[00:01.83]	+ Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,
[00:02.29]	+ CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,
[00:02.74]	+ TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS,
[00:03.20]	+ PUBLIUS, and others]
[00:03.66]CAESAR	[To the Soothsayer] The ides of March are come.
[00:06.64]Soothsayer	Ay, Caesar; but not gone.
[00:08.85]ARTEMIDORUS	Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
[00:11.68]DECIUS BRUTUS	Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
[00:15.04]	At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
[00:18.70]ARTEMIDORUS	O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
[00:22.45]	That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
[00:26.57]CAESAR	What touches us ourself shall be last served.
[00:30.47]ARTEMIDORUS	Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
[00:33.60]CAESAR	What, is the fellow mad?
[00:35.81]PUBLIUS	Sirrah, give place.
[00:37.64]CASSIUS	What, urge you your petitions in the street?
[00:41.39]	Come to the Capitol.
[00:43.37]	[CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest
[00:43.83]	+ following]
[00:44.29]POPILIUS	I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
[00:47.88]CASSIUS	What enterprise, Popilius?
[00:50.24]POPILIUS	Fare you well.
[00:51.77]	[Advances to CAESAR]
[00:52.69]BRUTUS	What said Popilius Lena?
[00:54.98]CASSIUS	He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
[00:58.87]	I fear our purpose is discovered.
[01:01.85]BRUTUS	Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.
[01:05.14]CASSIUS	Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
[01:08.57]	Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
[01:12.31]	Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
[01:15.83]	For I will slay myself.
[01:18.04]BRUTUS	Cassius, be constant:
[01:20.03]	Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
[01:23.62]	For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
[01:27.59]CASSIUS	Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
[01:31.48]	He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
[01:34.69]	[Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS]
[01:35.61]DECIUS BRUTUS	Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
[01:38.81]	And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
[01:42.33]BRUTUS	He is address'd: press near and second him.
[01:45.99]CINNA	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
[01:49.89]CAESAR	Are we all ready? What is now amiss
[01:53.02]	That Caesar and his senate must redress?
[01:56.53]METELLUS CIMBER	Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
[02:00.58]	Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
[02:04.02]	An humble heart,--
[02:05.70]	[Kneeling]
[02:06.61]CAESAR	I must prevent thee, Cimber.
[02:09.13]	These couchings and these lowly courtesies
[02:12.87]	Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
[02:16.16]	And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
[02:19.67]	Into the law of children. Be not fond,
[02:22.95]	To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
[02:26.77]	That will be thaw'd from the true quality
[02:30.44]	With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
[02:34.64]	Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
[02:38.76]	Thy brother by decree is banished:
[02:41.82]	If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
[02:45.64]	I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
[02:49.00]	Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
[02:52.89]	Will he be satisfied.
[02:54.95]METELLUS CIMBER	Is there no voice more worthy than my own
[02:58.62]	To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
[03:02.44]	For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
[03:06.03]BRUTUS	I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
[03:09.77]	Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
[03:13.13]	Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
[03:16.33]CAESAR	What, Brutus!
[03:17.71]CASSIUS	Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
[03:20.31]	As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
[03:23.82]	To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
[03:27.48]CASSIUS	I could be well moved, if I were as you:
[03:30.92]	If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
[03:34.89]	But I am constant as the northern star,
[03:38.33]	Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
[03:41.84]	There is no fellow in the firmament.
[03:45.05]	The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
[03:48.94]	They are all fire and every one doth shine,
[03:52.69]	But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
[03:56.73]	So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
[04:00.55]	And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
[04:04.45]	Yet in the number I do know but one
[04:07.65]	That unassailable holds on his rank,
[04:10.86]	Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
[04:14.07]	Let me a little show it, even in this;
[04:17.35]	That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
[04:21.32]	And constant do remain to keep him so.
[04:24.68]CINNA	O Caesar,--
[04:25.83]CAESAR	Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
[04:28.73]DECIUS BRUTUS	Great Caesar,--
[04:30.18]CAESAR	Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
[04:33.01]CASCA	Speak, hands for me!
[04:34.92]	[CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and
[04:35.37]	+ BRUTUS stab CAESAR]
[04:35.83]CAESAR	Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
[04:38.51]	[Dies]
[04:39.42]CINNA	Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
[04:42.32]	Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
[04:46.14]CASSIUS	Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
[04:49.58]	'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'
[04:52.79]BRUTUS	People and senators, be not affrighted;
[04:56.15]	Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
[04:59.96]CASCA	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
[05:02.26]DECIUS BRUTUS	And Cassius too.
[05:03.94]BRUTUS	Where's Publius?
[05:05.62]CINNA	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
[05:09.05]METELLUS CIMBER	Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
[05:13.25]	Should chance--
[05:14.78]BRUTUS	Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
[05:18.29]	There is no harm intended to your person,
[05:21.88]	Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.
[05:25.55]CASSIUS	And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
[05:29.21]	Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
[05:33.26]BRUTUS	Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
[05:36.54]	But we the doers.
[05:38.30]	[Re-enter TREBONIUS]
[05:39.22]CASSIUS	Where is Antony?
[05:40.90]TREBONIUS	Fled to his house amazed:
[05:43.26]	Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
[05:47.16]	As it were doomsday.
[05:49.15]BRUTUS	Fates, we will know your pleasures:
[05:52.20]	That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
[05:55.94]	And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
[05:59.53]CASSIUS	Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
[06:03.20]	Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
[06:06.71]BRUTUS	Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
[06:10.15]	So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
[06:14.12]	His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
[06:18.01]	And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
[06:21.91]	Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
[06:25.42]	Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
[06:29.24]	And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
[06:32.90]	Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'
[06:36.42]CASSIUS	Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
[06:39.93]	Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
[06:43.52]	In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
[06:47.11]BRUTUS	How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
[06:50.85]	That now on Pompey's basis lies along
[06:54.21]	No worthier than the dust!
[06:56.65]CASSIUS	So oft as that shall be,
[06:58.94]	So often shall the knot of us be call'd
[07:02.46]	The men that gave their country liberty.
[07:05.97]DECIUS BRUTUS	What, shall we forth?
[07:07.96]CASSIUS	Ay, every man away:
[07:09.79]	Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
[07:13.76]	With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
[07:17.73]	[Enter a Servant]
[07:18.65]BRUTUS	Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
[07:22.24]Servant	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
[07:25.67]	Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
[07:29.03]	And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
[07:32.55]	Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
[07:36.06]	Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
[07:39.57]	Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
[07:42.70]	Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
[07:46.75]	If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
[07:50.03]	May safely come to him, and be resolved
[07:53.47]	How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
[07:57.06]	Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
[08:00.50]	So well as Brutus living; but will follow
[08:04.09]	The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
[08:07.67]	Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
[08:11.34]	With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
[08:15.24]BRUTUS	Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
[08:18.67]	I never thought him worse.
[08:21.12]	Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
[08:24.93]	He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
[08:28.37]	Depart untouch'd.
[08:30.13]Servant	I'll fetch him presently.
[08:32.49]	[Exit]
[08:33.41]BRUTUS	I know that we shall have him well to friend.
[08:37.31]CASSIUS	I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
[08:40.51]	That fears him much; and my misgiving still
[08:44.25]	Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
[08:47.00]BRUTUS	But here comes Antony.
[08:49.14]	[Re-enter ANTONY]
[08:50.06]	Welcome, Mark Antony.
[08:52.04]ANTONY	O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
[08:55.33]	Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
[08:59.30]	Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
[09:03.19]	I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
[09:06.48]	Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
[09:10.30]	If I myself, there is no hour so fit
[09:13.50]	As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
[09:17.09]	Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
[09:21.37]	With the most noble blood of all this world.
[09:25.19]	I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
[09:28.39]	Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
[09:32.52]	Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
[09:36.26]	I shall not find myself so apt to die:
[09:39.62]	No place will please me so, no mean of death,
[09:43.44]	As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
[09:46.72]	The choice and master spirits of this age.
[09:50.39]BRUTUS	O Antony, beg not your death of us.
[09:53.44]	Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
[09:57.19]	As, by our hands and this our present act,
[10:00.77]	You see we do, yet see you but our hands
[10:04.29]	And this the bleeding business they have done:
[10:08.26]	Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
[10:11.77]	And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
[10:15.13]	As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
[10:18.42]	Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
[10:22.23]	To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
[10:26.43]	Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
[10:30.40]	Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
[10:33.69]	With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
[10:37.74]CASSIUS	Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
[10:41.48]	In the disposing of new dignities.
[10:44.53]BRUTUS	Only be patient till we have appeased
[10:47.89]	The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
[10:51.56]	And then we will deliver you the cause,
[10:54.99]	Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
[10:58.89]	Have thus proceeded.
[11:00.88]ANTONY	I doubt not of your wisdom.
[11:03.40]	Let each man render me his bloody hand:
[11:06.83]	First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
[11:10.50]	Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
[11:13.93]	Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
[11:17.68]	Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
[11:21.11]	Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
[11:25.39]	Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
[11:28.60]	My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
[11:32.49]	That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
[11:36.39]	Either a coward or a flatterer.
[11:39.21]	That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
[11:42.65]	If then thy spirit look upon us now,
[11:45.86]	Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
[11:49.90]	To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
[11:53.42]	Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
[11:56.85]	Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
[12:00.37]	Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
[12:03.80]	Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
[12:07.85]	It would become me better than to close
[12:11.36]	In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
[12:15.03]	Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
[12:19.23]	Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
[12:23.35]	Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
[12:27.40]	O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
[12:31.06]	And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
[12:34.73]	How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
[12:38.32]	Dost thou here lie!
[12:40.23]CASSIUS	Mark Antony,--
[12:41.60]ANTONY	Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
[12:43.89]	The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
[12:47.18]	Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
[12:50.39]CASSIUS	I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
[12:53.82]	But what compact mean you to have with us?
[12:57.49]	Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
[13:01.38]	Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
[13:04.67]ANTONY	Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
[13:08.41]	Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
[13:12.53]	Friends am I with you all and love you all,
[13:16.27]	Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
[13:20.25]	Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
[13:23.53]BRUTUS	Or else were this a savage spectacle:
[13:26.81]	Our reasons are so full of good regard
[13:30.25]	That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
[13:33.69]	You should be satisfied.
[13:35.98]ANTONY	That's all I seek:
[13:37.81]	And am moreover suitor that I may
[13:40.86]	Produce his body to the market-place;
[13:44.15]	And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
[13:47.51]	Speak in the order of his funeral.
[13:50.56]BRUTUS	You shall, Mark Antony.
[13:52.70]CASSIUS	Brutus, a word with you.
[13:54.92]	[Aside to BRUTUS]
[13:55.83]	You know not what you do: do not consent
[13:59.34]	That Antony speak in his funeral:
[14:02.32]	Know you how much the people may be moved
[14:05.99]	By that which he will utter?
[14:08.59]BRUTUS	By your pardon;
[14:10.19]	I will myself into the pulpit first,
[14:13.40]	And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
[14:17.06]	What Antony shall speak, I will protest
[14:20.50]	He speaks by leave and by permission,
[14:23.78]	And that we are contented Caesar shall
[14:27.22]	Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
[14:30.88]	It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
[14:34.47]CASSIUS	I know not what may fall; I like it not.
[14:37.91]BRUTUS	Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
[14:41.42]	You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
[14:45.39]	But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
[14:49.21]	And say you do't by our permission;
[14:52.34]	Else shall you not have any hand at all
[14:55.86]	About his funeral: and you shall speak
[14:59.22]	In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
[15:02.58]	After my speech is ended.
[15:04.94]ANTONY	Be it so.
[15:06.09]	I do desire no more.
[15:08.08]BRUTUS	Prepare the body then, and follow us.
[15:11.28]	[Exeunt all but ANTONY]
[15:12.20]ANTONY	O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
[15:15.79]	That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
[15:19.76]	Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
[15:23.12]	That ever lived in the tide of times.
[15:26.40]	Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
[15:30.22]	Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
[15:33.28]	Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
[15:37.25]	To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
[15:41.07]	A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
[15:44.73]	Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
[15:48.09]	Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
[15:51.30]	Blood and destruction shall be so in use
[15:54.89]	And dreadful objects so familiar
[15:57.87]	That mothers shall but smile when they behold
[16:01.84]	Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
[16:05.81]	All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
[16:09.47]	And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
[16:12.99]	With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
[16:16.50]	Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
[16:20.55]	Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
[16:23.98]	That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
[16:28.11]	With carrion men, groaning for burial.
[16:31.39]	[Enter a Servant]
[16:32.31]	You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
[16:35.59]Servant	I do, Mark Antony.
[16:37.35]ANTONY	Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
[16:40.94]Servant	He did receive his letters, and is coming;
[16:44.53]	And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
[16:47.96]	O Caesar!--
[16:49.11]	[Seeing the body]
[16:50.03]ANTONY	Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
[16:53.61]	Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
[16:57.13]	Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
[17:00.95]	Began to water. Is thy master coming?
[17:04.15]Servant	He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
[17:08.12]ANTONY	Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
[17:12.55]	Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
[17:16.14]	No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
[17:19.27]	Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
[17:22.94]	Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
[17:27.14]	Into the market-place: there shall I try
[17:30.65]	In my oration, how the people take
[17:33.71]	The cruel issue of these bloody men;
[17:36.91]	According to the which, thou shalt discourse
[17:40.73]	To young Octavius of the state of things.
[17:44.32]	Lend me your hand.
[17:46.15]	[Exeunt with CAESAR's body]
