[00:00.55]	[The Forum.,]
[00:01.65]	[Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens]
[00:02.75]Citizens	We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
[00:07.06]BRUTUS	Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
[00:11.64]	Cassius, go you into the other street,
[00:15.58]	And part the numbers.
[00:18.06]	Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
[00:22.92]	Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
[00:27.41]	And public reasons shall be rendered
[00:31.35]	Of Caesar's death.
[00:33.55]First Citizen	I will hear Brutus speak.
[00:36.40]Second Citizen	I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
[00:41.16]	When severally we hear them rendered.
[00:45.11]	[Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS
[00:45.66]	+ goes into the pulpit]
[00:46.21]Third Citizen	The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
[00:50.15]BRUTUS	Be patient till the last.
[00:52.99]	Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
[00:57.58]	cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
[01:02.62]	for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
[01:08.03]	you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
[01:12.80]	awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
[01:17.75]	If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
[01:23.06]	Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
[01:28.11]	was no less than his. If then that friend demand
[01:33.06]	why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
[01:38.10]	--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
[01:42.87]	Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
[01:47.82]	die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
[01:52.96]	all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
[01:57.81]	as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
[02:02.58]	valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
[02:07.44]	slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
[02:12.49]	fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
[02:17.44]	ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
[02:22.11]	bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
[02:26.79]	Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
[02:31.83]	any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
[02:36.87]	vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
[02:41.92]	for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
[02:46.50]All	None, Brutus, none.
[02:48.61]BRUTUS	Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
[02:53.65]	Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
[02:58.88]	his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
[03:04.11]	extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
[03:09.24]	enforced, for which he suffered death.
[03:13.18]	[Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body]
[03:14.28]	Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
[03:19.14]	though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
[03:24.19]	the benefit of his dying, a place in the
[03:28.40]	commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
[03:33.45]	I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
[03:38.21]	good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
[03:43.07]	when it shall please my country to need my death.
[03:48.12]All	Live, Brutus! live, live!
[03:50.68]First Citizen	Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
[03:55.18]Second Citizen	Give him a statue with his ancestors.
[03:59.12]Third Citizen	Let him be Caesar.
[04:01.32]Fourth Citizen	Caesar's better parts
[04:03.89]	Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
[04:06.91]First Citizen	We'll bring him to his house
[04:10.12]	With shouts and clamours.
[04:12.96]BRUTUS	My countrymen,--
[04:14.80]Second Citizen	Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
[04:17.92]First Citizen	Peace, ho!
[04:19.29]BRUTUS	Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
[04:23.14]	And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
[04:27.18]	Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
[04:32.22]	Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
[04:36.99]	By our permission, is allow'd to make.
[04:40.93]	I do entreat you, not a man depart,
[04:44.60]	Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
[04:48.45]	[Exit]
[04:49.55]First Citizen	Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
[04:53.40]Third Citizen	Let him go up into the public chair;
[04:57.25]	We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
[05:00.92]ANTONY	For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
[05:04.95]	[Goes into the pulpit]
[05:06.05]Fourth Citizen	What does he say of Brutus?
[05:09.08]Third Citizen	He says, for Brutus' sake,
[05:11.83]	He finds himself beholding to us all.
[05:15.77]Fourth Citizen	'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
[05:20.26]First Citizen	This Caesar was a tyrant.
[05:23.11]Third Citizen	Nay, that's certain:
[05:25.40]	We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
[05:29.34]Second Citizen	Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
[05:33.38]ANTONY	You gentle Romans,--
[05:35.58]Citizens	Peace, ho! let us hear him.
[05:38.42]ANTONY	Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
[05:43.00]	I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
[05:47.22]	The evil that men do lives after them;
[05:51.25]	The good is oft interred with their bones;
[05:55.66]	So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
[06:00.06]	Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
[06:03.82]	If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
[06:07.85]	And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
[06:11.98]	Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
[06:16.19]	For Brutus is an honourable man;
[06:19.68]	So are they all, all honourable men--
[06:23.44]	Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
[06:27.29]	He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
[06:31.60]	But Brutus says he was ambitious;
[06:35.17]	And Brutus is an honourable man.
[06:38.66]	He hath brought many captives home to Rome
[06:43.15]	Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
[06:47.64]	Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
[06:51.31]	When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
[06:56.17]	Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
[07:00.48]	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
[07:04.06]	And Brutus is an honourable man.
[07:07.54]	You all did see that on the Lupercal
[07:11.48]	I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
[07:15.52]	Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
[07:20.19]	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
[07:23.77]	And, sure, he is an honourable man.
[07:27.34]	I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
[07:31.75]	But here I am to speak what I do know.
[07:35.78]	You all did love him once, not without cause:
[07:40.36]	What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
[07:45.22]	O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
[07:49.72]	And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
[07:54.30]	My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
[07:58.89]	And I must pause till it come back to me.
[08:03.19]First Citizen	Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
[08:07.87]Second Citizen	If thou consider rightly of the matter,
[08:12.00]	Caesar has had great wrong.
[08:15.02]Third Citizen	Has he, masters?
[08:16.95]	I fear there will a worse come in his place.
[08:21.53]Fourth Citizen	Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
[08:26.48]	Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
[08:30.98]First Citizen	If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
[08:35.38]Second Citizen	Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
[08:40.33]Third Citizen	There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
[08:45.00]Fourth Citizen	Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
[08:49.04]ANTONY	But yesterday the word of Caesar might
[08:53.16]	Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
[08:58.02]	And none so poor to do him reverence.
[09:01.97]	O masters, if I were disposed to stir
[09:05.91]	Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
[09:10.22]	I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
[09:14.71]	Who, you all know, are honourable men:
[09:18.56]	I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
[09:22.87]	To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
[09:27.27]	Than I will wrong such honourable men.
[09:31.31]	But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
[09:36.17]	I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
[09:40.20]	Let but the commons hear this testament--
[09:44.42]	Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
[09:48.45]	And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
[09:53.40]	And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
[09:57.81]	Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
[10:01.38]	And, dying, mention it within their wills,
[10:05.60]	Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
[10:09.08]	Unto their issue.
[10:11.19]Fourth Citizen	We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
[10:15.41]All	The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
[10:20.09]ANTONY	Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
[10:25.04]	It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
[10:29.71]	You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
[10:34.30]	And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
[10:38.61]	It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
[10:42.92]	'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
[10:47.59]	For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
[10:51.99]Fourth Citizen	Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
[10:55.75]	You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
[11:00.06]ANTONY	Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
[11:04.37]	I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
[11:08.68]	I fear I wrong the honourable men
[11:12.35]	Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
[11:17.21]Fourth Citizen	They were traitors: honourable men!
[11:20.88]All	The will! the testament!
[11:23.53]Second Citizen	They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
[11:28.85]ANTONY	You will compel me, then, to read the will?
[11:33.16]	Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
[11:37.75]	And let me show you him that made the will.
[11:42.24]	Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
[11:46.73]Several Citizens	Come down.
[11:48.20]Second Citizen	Descend.
[11:49.48]Third Citizen	You shall have leave.
[11:51.96]	[ANTONY comes down]
[11:53.06]Fourth Citizen	A ring; stand round.
[11:55.35]First Citizen	Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
[11:59.75]Second Citizen	Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
[12:03.42]ANTONY	Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
[12:07.54]Several Citizens	Stand back; room; bear back.
[12:10.48]ANTONY	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
[12:14.97]	You all do know this mantle: I remember
[12:19.10]	The first time ever Caesar put it on;
[12:23.04]	'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
[12:27.17]	That day he overcame the Nervii:
[12:30.65]	Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
[12:35.42]	See what a rent the envious Casca made:
[12:39.54]	Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
[12:44.22]	And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
[12:48.44]	Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
[12:52.75]	As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
[12:56.87]	If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
[13:00.72]	For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
[13:05.13]	Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
[13:09.80]	This was the most unkindest cut of all;
[13:13.93]	For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
[13:18.05]	Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
[13:22.55]	Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
[13:27.59]	And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
[13:31.72]	Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
[13:35.57]	Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
[13:40.52]	O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
[13:44.55]	Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
[13:48.68]	Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
[13:52.99]	O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
[13:57.11]	The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
[14:01.51]	Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
[14:06.19]	Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
[14:10.68]	Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
[14:15.63]First Citizen	O piteous spectacle!
[14:18.02]Second Citizen	O noble Caesar!
[14:19.94]Third Citizen	O woful day!
[14:21.59]Fourth Citizen	O traitors, villains!
[14:23.98]First Citizen	O most bloody sight!
[14:26.36]Second Citizen	We will be revenged.
[14:28.75]All	Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
[14:32.87]	Let not a traitor live!
[14:35.53]ANTONY	Stay, countrymen.
[14:37.55]First Citizen	Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
[14:41.22]Second Citizen	We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
[14:46.44]ANTONY	Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
[14:51.58]	To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
[14:55.15]	They that have done this deed are honourable:
[14:59.83]	What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
[15:04.60]	That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
[15:09.73]	And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
[15:14.13]	I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
[15:18.81]	I am no orator, as Brutus is;
[15:21.92]	But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
[15:26.23]	That love my friend; and that they know full well
[15:31.28]	That gave me public leave to speak of him:
[15:35.68]	For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
[15:40.17]	Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
[15:44.85]	To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
[15:49.25]	I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
[15:53.92]	Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
[15:59.33]	And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
[16:03.92]	And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
[16:08.04]	Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
[16:12.81]	In every wound of Caesar that should move
[16:17.21]	The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
[16:21.25]All	We'll mutiny.
[16:22.99]First Citizen	We'll burn the house of Brutus.
[16:26.38]Third Citizen	Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
[16:30.32]ANTONY	Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
[16:34.63]All	Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
[16:38.76]ANTONY	Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
[16:43.25]	Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
[16:47.93]	Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
[16:52.05]	You have forgot the will I told you of.
[16:56.18]All	Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
[17:01.13]ANTONY	Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
[17:05.44]	To every Roman citizen he gives,
[17:08.93]	To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
[17:13.42]Second Citizen	Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
[17:17.82]Third Citizen	O royal Caesar!
[17:19.74]ANTONY	Hear me with patience.
[17:22.31]All	Peace, ho!
[17:23.69]ANTONY	Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
[17:27.91]	His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
[17:32.58]	On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
[17:36.89]	And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
[17:41.48]	To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
[17:45.60]	Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
[17:50.00]First Citizen	Never, never. Come, away, away!
[17:53.03]	We'll burn his body in the holy place,
[17:57.06]	And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
[18:01.74]	Take up the body.
[18:03.85]Second Citizen	Go fetch fire.
[18:05.68]Third Citizen	Pluck down benches.
[18:07.97]Fourth Citizen	Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
[18:11.73]	[Exeunt Citizens with the body]
[18:12.83]ANTONY	Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
[18:17.05]	Take thou what course thou wilt!
[18:20.53]	[Enter a Servant]
[18:21.63]	How now, fellow!
[18:23.56]Servant	Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
[18:27.50]ANTONY	Where is he?
[18:29.15]Servant	He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
[18:33.10]ANTONY	And thither will I straight to visit him:
[18:37.41]	He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
[18:41.44]	And in this mood will give us any thing.
[18:45.66]Servant	I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
[18:49.42]	Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
[18:54.18]ANTONY	Belike they had some notice of the people,
[18:58.59]	How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
[19:02.99]	[Exeunt]
