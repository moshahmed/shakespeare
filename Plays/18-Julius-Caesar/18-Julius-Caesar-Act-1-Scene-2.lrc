[00:00.40]	[A public place.,]
[00:01.21]	[Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;
[00:01.61]	+ CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,
[00:02.02]	+ CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among
[00:02.42]	+ them a Soothsayer]
[00:02.83]CAESAR	Calpurnia!
[00:03.91]CASCA	Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
[00:05.86]CAESAR	Calpurnia!
[00:06.94]CALPURNIA	Here, my lord.
[00:08.22]CAESAR	Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
[00:10.99]	When he doth run his course. Antonius!
[00:13.89]ANTONY	Caesar, my lord?
[00:15.31]CAESAR	Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
[00:18.00]	To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
[00:20.97]	The barren, touched in this holy chase,
[00:23.94]	Shake off their sterile curse.
[00:26.37]ANTONY	I shall remember:
[00:27.92]	When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.
[00:31.09]CAESAR	Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
[00:33.72]	[Flourish]
[00:34.53]Soothsayer	Caesar!
[00:35.41]CAESAR	Ha! who calls?
[00:36.69]CASCA	Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
[00:39.86]CAESAR	Who is it in the press that calls on me?
[00:42.96]	I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
[00:46.33]	Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.
[00:49.57]Soothsayer	Beware the ides of March.
[00:51.66]CAESAR	What man is that?
[00:53.21]BRUTUS	A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
[00:56.79]CAESAR	Set him before me; let me see his face.
[00:59.76]CASSIUS	Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
[01:03.20]CAESAR	What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
[01:06.57]Soothsayer	Beware the ides of March.
[01:08.66]CAESAR	He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
[01:11.63]	[Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS]
[01:12.44]CASSIUS	Will you go see the order of the course?
[01:15.54]BRUTUS	Not I.
[01:16.35]CASSIUS	I pray you, do.
[01:17.70]BRUTUS	I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
[01:20.67]	Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
[01:23.70]	Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
[01:26.74]	I'll leave you.
[01:28.15]CASSIUS	Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
[01:30.99]	I have not from your eyes that gentleness
[01:34.22]	And show of love as I was wont to have:
[01:37.26]	You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
[01:40.70]	Over your friend that loves you.
[01:43.26]BRUTUS	Cassius,
[01:44.21]	Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
[01:47.38]	I turn the trouble of my countenance
[01:50.28]	Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
[01:52.71]	Of late with passions of some difference,
[01:55.88]	Conceptions only proper to myself,
[01:58.57]	Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
[02:02.01]	But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
[02:05.72]	Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
[02:08.69]	Nor construe any further my neglect,
[02:11.52]	Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
[02:14.76]	Forgets the shows of love to other men.
[02:17.80]CASSIUS	Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
[02:21.24]	By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
[02:24.95]	Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
[02:28.25]	Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
[02:31.49]BRUTUS	No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
[02:34.52]	But by reflection, by some other things.
[02:37.56]CASSIUS	'Tis just:
[02:38.57]	And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
[02:41.40]	That you have no such mirrors as will turn
[02:44.71]	Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
[02:47.61]	That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
[02:50.98]	Where many of the best respect in Rome,
[02:54.02]	Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
[02:57.26]	And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
[03:00.36]	Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
[03:03.66]BRUTUS	Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
[03:07.04]	That you would have me seek into myself
[03:10.14]	For that which is not in me?
[03:12.43]CASSIUS	Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
[03:15.67]	And since you know you cannot see yourself
[03:18.97]	So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
[03:21.94]	Will modestly discover to yourself
[03:24.71]	That of yourself which you yet know not of.
[03:28.01]	And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
[03:31.05]	Were I a common laugher, or did use
[03:33.81]	To stale with ordinary oaths my love
[03:36.71]	To every new protester; if you know
[03:39.48]	That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
[03:42.58]	And after scandal them, or if you know
[03:45.55]	That I profess myself in banqueting
[03:48.38]	To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
[03:51.42]	[Flourish, and shout]
[03:52.23]BRUTUS	What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
[03:55.74]	Choose Caesar for their king.
[03:58.10]CASSIUS	Ay, do you fear it?
[03:59.71]	Then must I think you would not have it so.
[04:03.02]BRUTUS	I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
[04:06.12]	But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
[04:09.36]	What is it that you would impart to me?
[04:12.40]	If it be aught toward the general good,
[04:15.43]	Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
[04:18.80]	And I will look on both indifferently,
[04:21.77]	For let the gods so speed me as I love
[04:24.81]	The name of honour more than I fear death.
[04:28.04]CASSIUS	I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
[04:31.08]	As well as I do know your outward favour.
[04:34.25]	Well, honour is the subject of my story.
[04:37.28]	I cannot tell what you and other men
[04:40.19]	Think of this life; but, for my single self,
[04:43.42]	I had as lief not be as live to be
[04:46.19]	In awe of such a thing as I myself.
[04:48.95]	I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
[04:51.92]	We both have fed as well, and we can both
[04:55.09]	Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
[04:58.13]	For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
[05:00.82]	The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
[05:04.13]	Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
[05:07.37]	Leap in with me into this angry flood,
[05:10.34]	And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
[05:13.37]	Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
[05:15.93]	And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
[05:18.83]	The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
[05:21.94]	With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
[05:24.77]	And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
[05:28.08]	But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
[05:31.38]	Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
[05:34.42]	I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
[05:36.91]	Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
[05:40.42]	The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
[05:44.13]	Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
[05:46.96]	Is now become a god, and Cassius is
[05:49.73]	A wretched creature and must bend his body,
[05:53.03]	If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
[05:55.86]	He had a fever when he was in Spain,
[05:58.70]	And when the fit was on him, I did mark
[06:01.73]	How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
[06:05.17]	His coward lips did from their colour fly,
[06:08.41]	And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
[06:12.05]	Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
[06:15.22]	Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
[06:18.80]	Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
[06:22.37]	Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
[06:25.61]	As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
[06:28.71]	A man of such a feeble temper should
[06:31.61]	So get the start of the majestic world
[06:34.65]	And bear the palm alone.
[06:36.67]	[Shout. Flourish]
[06:37.48]BRUTUS	Another general shout!
[06:39.37]	I do believe that these applauses are
[06:42.34]	For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
[06:45.91]CASSIUS	Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
[06:49.15]	Like a Colossus, and we petty men
[06:51.78]	Walk under his huge legs and peep about
[06:54.88]	To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
[06:57.92]	Men at some time are masters of their fates:
[07:01.29]	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
[07:04.53]	But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
[07:07.63]	Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
[07:11.27]	Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
[07:14.92]	Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
[07:18.29]	Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
[07:21.66]	Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
[07:24.90]	Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
[07:28.34]	Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
[07:31.51]	Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
[07:34.68]	That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
[07:38.19]	Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
[07:41.69]	When went there by an age, since the great flood,
[07:45.34]	But it was famed with more than with one man?
[07:48.78]	When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
[07:52.49]	That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
[07:55.86]	Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
[07:58.83]	When there is in it but one only man.
[08:01.73]	O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
[08:04.76]	There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
[08:08.41]	The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
[08:11.78]	As easily as a king.
[08:13.53]BRUTUS	That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
[08:16.70]	What you would work me to, I have some aim:
[08:19.94]	How I have thought of this and of these times,
[08:23.45]	I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
[08:26.75]	I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
[08:30.19]	Be any further moved. What you have said
[08:33.29]	I will consider; what you have to say
[08:36.19]	I will with patience hear, and find a time
[08:39.43]	Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
[08:42.94]	Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
[08:46.11]	Brutus had rather be a villager
[08:48.67]	Than to repute himself a son of Rome
[08:51.57]	Under these hard conditions as this time
[08:54.74]	Is like to lay upon us.
[08:56.70]CASSIUS	I am glad that my weak words
[08:59.06]	Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
[09:02.91]BRUTUS	The games are done and Caesar is returning.
[09:06.21]CASSIUS	As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
[09:09.45]	And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
[09:12.82]	What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
[09:15.86]	[Re-enter CAESAR and his Train]
[09:16.67]BRUTUS	I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
[09:19.36]	The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
[09:22.60]	And all the rest look like a chidden train:
[09:25.91]	Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
[09:28.81]	Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
[09:32.11]	As we have seen him in the Capitol,
[09:34.88]	Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
[09:38.32]CASSIUS	Casca will tell us what the matter is.
[09:41.28]CAESAR	Antonius!
[09:42.30]ANTONY	Caesar?
[09:43.17]CAESAR	Let me have men about me that are fat;
[09:46.14]	Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
[09:49.51]	Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
[09:52.62]	He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
[09:55.85]ANTONY	Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
[09:58.89]	He is a noble Roman and well given.
[10:01.65]CAESAR	Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
[10:04.76]	Yet if my name were liable to fear,
[10:07.52]	I do not know the man I should avoid
[10:10.42]	So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
[10:13.80]	He is a great observer and he looks
[10:16.63]	Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
[10:20.34]	As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
[10:23.31]	Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
[10:26.61]	As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
[10:30.19]	That could be moved to smile at any thing.
[10:33.42]	Such men as he be never at heart's ease
[10:36.53]	Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
[10:39.97]	And therefore are they very dangerous.
[10:42.93]	I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
[10:46.04]	Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
[10:49.14]	Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
[10:52.45]	And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
[10:55.82]	[Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA]
[10:56.63]CASCA	You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
[11:00.47]BRUTUS	Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
[11:03.71]	That Caesar looks so sad.
[11:05.80]CASCA	Why, you were with him, were you not?
[11:08.57]BRUTUS	I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
[11:12.01]CASCA	Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
[11:15.38]	offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
[11:19.22]	thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
[11:22.39]BRUTUS	What was the second noise for?
[11:24.82]CASCA	Why, for that too.
[11:26.37]CASSIUS	They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
[11:29.88]CASCA	Why, for that too.
[11:31.43]BRUTUS	Was the crown offered him thrice?
[11:34.06]CASCA	Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
[11:37.50]	time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
[11:41.14]	mine honest neighbours shouted.
[11:43.64]CASSIUS	Who offered him the crown?
[11:45.80]CASCA	Why, Antony.
[11:46.95]BRUTUS	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
[11:49.91]CASCA	I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
[11:53.62]	it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
[11:57.33]	Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
[12:00.84]	neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
[12:04.55]	you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
[12:07.99]	thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
[12:11.30]	offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
[12:14.94]	but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
[12:18.58]	fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
[12:22.22]	time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
[12:25.93]	refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
[12:29.78]	chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
[12:33.62]	and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
[12:37.47]	Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
[12:41.31]	Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
[12:44.89]	for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
[12:48.53]	opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
[12:51.77]CASSIUS	But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
[12:55.07]CASCA	He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
[12:58.65]	mouth, and was speechless.
[13:00.74]BRUTUS	'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
[13:04.04]CASSIUS	No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
[13:06.87]	And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
[13:10.38]CASCA	I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
[13:13.96]	Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
[13:17.53]	clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
[13:21.31]	displeased them, as they use to do the players in
[13:25.02]	the theatre, I am no true man.
[13:27.38]BRUTUS	What said he when he came unto himself?
[13:30.41]CASCA	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
[13:34.06]	common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
[13:37.50]	plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
[13:41.14]	throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
[13:44.31]	occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
[13:48.15]	I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
[13:52.00]	he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
[13:55.51]	If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
[13:59.28]	their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
[14:03.13]	or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
[14:06.64]	soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
[14:10.21]	there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
[14:13.99]	stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
[14:17.83]BRUTUS	And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
[14:20.73]CASCA	Ay.
[14:21.34]CASSIUS	Did Cicero say any thing?
[14:23.43]CASCA	Ay, he spoke Greek.
[14:25.05]CASSIUS	To what effect?
[14:26.47]CASCA	Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
[14:30.11]	face again: but those that understood him smiled at
[14:33.95]	one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
[14:37.80]	part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
[14:41.31]	news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
[14:45.02]	off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
[14:48.66]	well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
[14:51.96]	remember it.
[14:53.18]CASSIUS	Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
[14:56.01]CASCA	No, I am promised forth.
[14:57.97]CASSIUS	Will you dine with me to-morrow?
[15:00.53]CASCA	Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
[15:04.44]	worth the eating.
[15:05.99]CASSIUS	Good: I will expect you.
[15:07.95]CASCA	Do so. Farewell, both.
[15:09.70]	[Exit]
[15:10.51]BRUTUS	What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
[15:13.61]	He was quick mettle when he went to school.
[15:16.92]CASSIUS	So is he now in execution
[15:19.08]	Of any bold or noble enterprise,
[15:21.64]	However he puts on this tardy form.
[15:24.41]	This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
[15:27.58]	Which gives men stomach to digest his words
[15:30.95]	With better appetite.
[15:32.77]BRUTUS	And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
[15:36.14]	To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
[15:39.31]	I will come home to you; or, if you will,
[15:42.35]	Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
[15:45.45]CASSIUS	I will do so: till then, think of the world.
[15:48.69]	[Exit BRUTUS]
[15:49.50]	Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
[15:52.40]	Thy honourable metal may be wrought
[15:55.23]	From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
[15:58.74]	That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
[16:02.11]	For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
[16:05.15]	Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
[16:08.59]	If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
[16:11.76]	He should not humour me. I will this night,
[16:14.99]	In several hands, in at his windows throw,
[16:18.16]	As if they came from several citizens,
[16:21.13]	Writings all tending to the great opinion
[16:24.37]	That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
[16:27.88]	Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
[16:30.85]	And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
[16:33.95]	For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
[16:37.25]	[Exit]
