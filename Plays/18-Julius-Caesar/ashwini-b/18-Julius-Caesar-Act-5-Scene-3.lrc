[00:00.47]	[Another part of the field.,]
[00:01.41]	[Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS]
[00:02.36]CASSIUS	O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
[00:05.82]	Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
[00:09.20]	This ensign here of mine was turning back;
[00:12.98]	I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
[00:16.84]TITINIUS	O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
[00:20.54]	Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
[00:24.00]	Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
[00:28.17]	Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
[00:31.55]	[Enter PINDARUS]
[00:32.50]PINDARUS	Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
[00:36.12]	Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
[00:39.50]	Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
[00:43.12]CASSIUS	This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
[00:46.98]	Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
[00:50.99]TITINIUS	They are, my lord.
[00:52.80]CASSIUS	Titinius, if thou lovest me,
[00:55.40]	Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
[00:59.49]	Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
[01:03.58]	And here again; that I may rest assured
[01:07.12]	Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
[01:10.74]TITINIUS	I will be here again, even with a thought.
[01:14.44]	[Exit]
[01:15.39]CASSIUS	Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
[01:18.69]	My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
[01:22.31]	And tell me what thou notest about the field.
[01:26.33]	[PINDARUS ascends the hill]
[01:27.27]	This day I breathed first: time is come round,
[01:31.28]	And where I did begin, there shall I end;
[01:34.90]	My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
[01:38.84]PINDARUS	[Above] O my lord!
[01:40.57]CASSIUS	What news?
[01:41.83]PINDARUS	[Above] Titinius is enclosed round about
[01:45.37]	With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
[01:49.23]	Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
[01:53.08]	Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
[01:57.02]	He's ta'en.
[01:58.36]	[Shout]
[01:59.30]	And, hark! they shout for joy.
[02:01.98]CASSIUS	Come down, behold no more.
[02:04.42]	O, coward that I am, to live so long,
[02:07.64]	To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
[02:11.50]	[PINDARUS descends]
[02:12.44]	Come hither, sirrah:
[02:14.41]	In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
[02:17.72]	And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
[02:21.41]	That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
[02:24.56]	Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
[02:28.97]	Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
[02:32.75]	That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
[02:37.23]	Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
[02:41.25]	And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
[02:44.79]	Guide thou the sword.
[02:46.91]	[PINDARUS stabs him]
[02:47.86]	Caesar, thou art revenged,
[02:50.30]	Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
[02:53.68]	[Dies]
[02:54.63]PINDARUS	So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
[02:58.25]	Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
[03:01.55]	Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
[03:05.25]	Where never Roman shall take note of him.
[03:08.95]	[Exit]
[03:09.89]	[Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA]
[03:10.84]MESSALA	It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
[03:14.38]	Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
[03:17.68]	As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
[03:20.75]TITINIUS	These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
[03:24.37]MESSALA	Where did you leave him?
[03:26.73]TITINIUS	All disconsolate,
[03:28.54]	With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
[03:32.09]MESSALA	Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
[03:35.78]TITINIUS	He lies not like the living. O my heart!
[03:39.33]MESSALA	Is not that he?
[03:40.98]TITINIUS	No, this was he, Messala,
[03:43.26]	But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
[03:46.64]	As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
[03:50.50]	So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
[03:54.04]	The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
[03:57.58]	Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
[04:01.83]	Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
[04:05.69]MESSALA	Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
[04:09.70]	O hateful error, melancholy's child,
[04:12.93]	Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
[04:17.02]	The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
[04:21.19]	Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
[04:24.58]	But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
[04:28.51]TITINIUS	What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
[04:31.97]MESSALA	Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
[04:35.44]	The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
[04:38.98]	Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
[04:42.36]	For piercing steel and darts envenomed
[04:45.90]	Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
[04:49.68]	As tidings of this sight.
[04:52.12]TITINIUS	Hie you, Messala,
[04:53.85]	And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
[04:57.39]	[Exit MESSALA]
[04:58.34]	Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
[05:02.19]	Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
[05:06.13]	Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
[05:09.67]	And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
[05:14.63]	Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
[05:18.25]	But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
[05:22.18]	Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
[05:25.57]	Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
[05:29.03]	And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
[05:32.41]	By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
[05:36.19]	Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
[05:40.05]	[Kills himself]
[05:40.99]	[Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO,
[05:44.69]	+ STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS]
[05:47.52]BRUTUS	Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
[05:50.99]MESSALA	Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
[05:54.21]BRUTUS	Titinius' face is upward.
[05:56.57]CATO	He is slain.
[05:57.99]BRUTUS	O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
[06:01.30]	Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
[06:05.31]	In our own proper entrails.
[06:07.91]	[Low alarums]
[06:08.85]CATO	Brave Titinius!
[06:10.50]	Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
[06:14.60]BRUTUS	Are yet two Romans living such as these?
[06:18.22]	The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
[06:21.99]	It is impossible that ever Rome
[06:24.98]	Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
[06:29.31]	To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
[06:33.17]	I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
[06:37.10]	Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
[06:40.96]	His funerals shall not be in our camp,
[06:44.42]	Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
[06:47.73]	And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
[06:51.35]	Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
[06:54.73]	'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
[06:58.59]	We shall try fortune in a second fight.
[07:02.13]	[Exeunt]
