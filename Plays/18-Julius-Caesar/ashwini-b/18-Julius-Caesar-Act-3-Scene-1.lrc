[00:00.44]	[Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.,]
[00:01.34]	[A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the
[00:05.45]	+ Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,
[00:08.89]	+ CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,
[00:12.62]	+ TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS,
[00:16.06]	+ PUBLIUS, and others]
[00:17.93]CAESAR	[To the Soothsayer] The ides of March are come.
[00:20.84]Soothsayer	Ay, Caesar; but not gone.
[00:23.01]ARTEMIDORUS	Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
[00:25.77]DECIUS BRUTUS	Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
[00:29.06]	At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
[00:32.65]ARTEMIDORUS	O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
[00:36.31]	That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
[00:40.34]CAESAR	What touches us ourself shall be last served.
[00:44.15]ARTEMIDORUS	Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
[00:47.21]CAESAR	What, is the fellow mad?
[00:49.38]PUBLIUS	Sirrah, give place.
[00:51.17]CASSIUS	What, urge you your petitions in the street?
[00:54.84]	Come to the Capitol.
[00:56.78]	[CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest
[01:00.51]	+ following]
[01:01.71]POPILIUS	I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
[01:05.22]CASSIUS	What enterprise, Popilius?
[01:07.54]POPILIUS	Fare you well.
[01:09.03]	[Advances to CAESAR]
[01:09.93]BRUTUS	What said Popilius Lena?
[01:12.17]CASSIUS	He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
[01:15.98]	I fear our purpose is discovered.
[01:18.89]BRUTUS	Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.
[01:22.11]CASSIUS	Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
[01:25.47]	Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
[01:29.13]	Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
[01:32.57]	For I will slay myself.
[01:34.73]BRUTUS	Cassius, be constant:
[01:36.68]	Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
[01:40.19]	For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
[01:44.07]CASSIUS	Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
[01:47.88]	He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
[01:51.02]	[Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS]
[01:51.92]DECIUS BRUTUS	Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
[01:55.06]	And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
[01:58.49]BRUTUS	He is address'd: press near and second him.
[02:02.08]CINNA	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
[02:05.89]CAESAR	Are we all ready? What is now amiss
[02:08.95]	That Caesar and his senate must redress?
[02:12.39]METELLUS CIMBER	Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
[02:16.35]	Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
[02:19.71]	An humble heart,--
[02:21.36]	[Kneeling]
[02:22.25]CAESAR	I must prevent thee, Cimber.
[02:24.72]	These couchings and these lowly courtesies
[02:28.38]	Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
[02:31.59]	And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
[02:35.03]	Into the law of children. Be not fond,
[02:38.24]	To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
[02:41.98]	That will be thaw'd from the true quality
[02:45.56]	With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
[02:49.67]	Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
[02:53.71]	Thy brother by decree is banished:
[02:56.70]	If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
[03:00.43]	I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
[03:03.72]	Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
[03:07.53]	Will he be satisfied.
[03:09.55]METELLUS CIMBER	Is there no voice more worthy than my own
[03:13.13]	To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
[03:16.87]	For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
[03:20.38]BRUTUS	I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
[03:24.04]	Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
[03:27.33]	Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
[03:30.47]CAESAR	What, Brutus!
[03:31.81]CASSIUS	Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
[03:34.35]	As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
[03:37.79]	To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
[03:41.37]CASSIUS	I could be well moved, if I were as you:
[03:44.74]	If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
[03:48.62]	But I am constant as the northern star,
[03:51.98]	Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
[03:55.42]	There is no fellow in the firmament.
[03:58.56]	The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
[04:02.37]	They are all fire and every one doth shine,
[04:06.03]	But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
[04:09.99]	So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
[04:13.73]	And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
[04:17.54]	Yet in the number I do know but one
[04:20.67]	That unassailable holds on his rank,
[04:23.81]	Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
[04:26.95]	Let me a little show it, even in this;
[04:30.16]	That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
[04:34.05]	And constant do remain to keep him so.
[04:37.34]CINNA	O Caesar,--
[04:38.46]CAESAR	Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
[04:41.30]DECIUS BRUTUS	Great Caesar,--
[04:42.72]CAESAR	Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
[04:45.48]CASCA	Speak, hands for me!
[04:47.35]	[CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and
[04:51.08]	+ BRUTUS stab CAESAR]
[04:52.95]CAESAR	Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
[04:55.57]	[Dies]
[04:56.46]CINNA	Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
[04:59.30]	Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
[05:03.04]CASSIUS	Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
[05:06.40]	'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'
[05:09.54]BRUTUS	People and senators, be not affrighted;
[05:12.83]	Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
[05:16.56]CASCA	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
[05:18.80]DECIUS BRUTUS	And Cassius too.
[05:20.45]BRUTUS	Where's Publius?
[05:22.09]CINNA	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
[05:25.45]METELLUS CIMBER	Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
[05:29.56]	Should chance--
[05:31.06]BRUTUS	Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
[05:34.49]	There is no harm intended to your person,
[05:38.00]	Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.
[05:41.59]CASSIUS	And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
[05:45.18]	Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
[05:49.14]BRUTUS	Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
[05:52.35]	But we the doers.
[05:54.07]	[Re-enter TREBONIUS]
[05:54.96]CASSIUS	Where is Antony?
[05:56.61]TREBONIUS	Fled to his house amazed:
[05:58.92]	Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
[06:02.73]	As it were doomsday.
[06:04.68]BRUTUS	Fates, we will know your pleasures:
[06:07.67]	That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
[06:11.33]	And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
[06:14.84]CASSIUS	Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
[06:18.42]	Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
[06:21.86]BRUTUS	Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
[06:25.22]	So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
[06:29.11]	His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
[06:32.92]	And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
[06:36.73]	Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
[06:40.17]	Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
[06:43.90]	And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
[06:47.49]	Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'
[06:50.93]CASSIUS	Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
[06:54.36]	Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
[06:57.87]	In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
[07:01.39]BRUTUS	How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
[07:05.05]	That now on Pompey's basis lies along
[07:08.33]	No worthier than the dust!
[07:10.72]CASSIUS	So oft as that shall be,
[07:12.97]	So often shall the knot of us be call'd
[07:16.40]	The men that gave their country liberty.
[07:19.84]DECIUS BRUTUS	What, shall we forth?
[07:21.78]CASSIUS	Ay, every man away:
[07:23.58]	Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
[07:27.46]	With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
[07:31.35]	[Enter a Servant]
[07:32.24]BRUTUS	Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
[07:35.75]Servant	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
[07:39.12]	Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
[07:42.40]	And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
[07:45.84]	Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
[07:49.28]	Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
[07:52.71]	Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
[07:55.78]	Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
[07:59.74]	If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
[08:02.95]	May safely come to him, and be resolved
[08:06.31]	How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
[08:09.82]	Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
[08:13.19]	So well as Brutus living; but will follow
[08:16.70]	The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
[08:20.21]	Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
[08:23.80]	With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
[08:27.61]BRUTUS	Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
[08:30.97]	I never thought him worse.
[08:33.36]	Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
[08:37.10]	He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
[08:40.46]	Depart untouch'd.
[08:42.18]Servant	I'll fetch him presently.
[08:44.49]	[Exit]
[08:45.39]BRUTUS	I know that we shall have him well to friend.
[08:49.20]CASSIUS	I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
[08:52.34]	That fears him much; and my misgiving still
[08:56.00]	Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
[08:58.69]BRUTUS	But here comes Antony.
[09:00.78]	[Re-enter ANTONY]
[09:01.68]	Welcome, Mark Antony.
[09:03.62]ANTONY	O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
[09:06.83]	Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
[09:10.72]	Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
[09:14.53]	I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
[09:17.74]	Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
[09:21.48]	If I myself, there is no hour so fit
[09:24.61]	As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
[09:28.13]	Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
[09:32.31]	With the most noble blood of all this world.
[09:36.04]	I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
[09:39.18]	Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
[09:43.22]	Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
[09:46.88]	I shall not find myself so apt to die:
[09:50.17]	No place will please me so, no mean of death,
[09:53.90]	As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
[09:57.11]	The choice and master spirits of this age.
[10:00.70]BRUTUS	O Antony, beg not your death of us.
[10:03.69]	Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
[10:07.35]	As, by our hands and this our present act,
[10:10.86]	You see we do, yet see you but our hands
[10:14.30]	And this the bleeding business they have done:
[10:18.18]	Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
[10:21.62]	And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
[10:24.91]	As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
[10:28.12]	Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
[10:31.86]	To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
[10:35.97]	Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
[10:39.85]	Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
[10:43.06]	With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
[10:47.02]CASSIUS	Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
[10:50.68]	In the disposing of new dignities.
[10:53.67]BRUTUS	Only be patient till we have appeased
[10:56.96]	The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
[11:00.55]	And then we will deliver you the cause,
[11:03.91]	Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
[11:07.72]	Have thus proceeded.
[11:09.66]ANTONY	I doubt not of your wisdom.
[11:12.13]	Let each man render me his bloody hand:
[11:15.49]	First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
[11:19.08]	Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
[11:22.44]	Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
[11:26.10]	Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
[11:29.46]	Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
[11:33.65]	Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
[11:36.78]	My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
[11:40.59]	That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
[11:44.40]	Either a coward or a flatterer.
[11:47.17]	That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
[11:50.53]	If then thy spirit look upon us now,
[11:53.67]	Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
[11:57.63]	To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
[12:01.07]	Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
[12:04.43]	Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
[12:07.87]	Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
[12:11.23]	Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
[12:15.19]	It would become me better than to close
[12:18.62]	In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
[12:22.21]	Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
[12:26.32]	Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
[12:30.35]	Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
[12:34.31]	O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
[12:37.90]	And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
[12:41.49]	How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
[12:45.00]	Dost thou here lie!
[12:46.87]CASSIUS	Mark Antony,--
[12:48.21]ANTONY	Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
[12:50.45]	The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
[12:53.67]	Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
[12:56.80]CASSIUS	I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
[13:00.17]	But what compact mean you to have with us?
[13:03.75]	Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
[13:07.56]	Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
[13:10.77]ANTONY	Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
[13:14.44]	Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
[13:18.47]	Friends am I with you all and love you all,
[13:22.13]	Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
[13:26.02]	Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
[13:29.23]BRUTUS	Or else were this a savage spectacle:
[13:32.44]	Our reasons are so full of good regard
[13:35.80]	That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
[13:39.17]	You should be satisfied.
[13:41.41]ANTONY	That's all I seek:
[13:43.20]	And am moreover suitor that I may
[13:46.19]	Produce his body to the market-place;
[13:49.40]	And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
[13:52.69]	Speak in the order of his funeral.
[13:55.68]BRUTUS	You shall, Mark Antony.
[13:57.77]CASSIUS	Brutus, a word with you.
[13:59.94]	[Aside to BRUTUS]
[14:00.83]	You know not what you do: do not consent
[14:04.27]	That Antony speak in his funeral:
[14:07.18]	Know you how much the people may be moved
[14:10.77]	By that which he will utter?
[14:13.31]BRUTUS	By your pardon;
[14:14.88]	I will myself into the pulpit first,
[14:18.02]	And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
[14:21.60]	What Antony shall speak, I will protest
[14:24.97]	He speaks by leave and by permission,
[14:28.18]	And that we are contented Caesar shall
[14:31.54]	Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
[14:35.13]	It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
[14:38.64]CASSIUS	I know not what may fall; I like it not.
[14:42.00]BRUTUS	Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
[14:45.44]	You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
[14:49.32]	But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
[14:53.06]	And say you do't by our permission;
[14:56.12]	Else shall you not have any hand at all
[14:59.56]	About his funeral: and you shall speak
[15:02.85]	In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
[15:06.13]	After my speech is ended.
[15:08.45]ANTONY	Be it so.
[15:09.57]	I do desire no more.
[15:11.51]BRUTUS	Prepare the body then, and follow us.
[15:14.65]	[Exeunt all but ANTONY]
[15:15.55]ANTONY	O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
[15:19.06]	That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
[15:22.95]	Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
[15:26.23]	That ever lived in the tide of times.
[15:29.45]	Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
[15:33.18]	Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
[15:36.17]	Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
[15:40.05]	To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
[15:43.79]	A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
[15:47.38]	Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
[15:50.66]	Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
[15:53.80]	Blood and destruction shall be so in use
[15:57.31]	And dreadful objects so familiar
[16:00.23]	That mothers shall but smile when they behold
[16:04.11]	Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
[16:08.00]	All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
[16:11.58]	And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
[16:15.02]	With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
[16:18.46]	Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
[16:22.42]	Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
[16:25.78]	That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
[16:29.81]	With carrion men, groaning for burial.
[16:33.03]	[Enter a Servant]
[16:33.92]	You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
[16:37.14]Servant	I do, Mark Antony.
[16:38.86]ANTONY	Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
[16:42.37]Servant	He did receive his letters, and is coming;
[16:45.88]	And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
[16:49.24]	O Caesar!--
[16:50.36]	[Seeing the body]
[16:51.26]ANTONY	Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
[16:54.77]	Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
[16:58.21]	Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
[17:01.94]	Began to water. Is thy master coming?
[17:05.08]Servant	He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
[17:08.97]ANTONY	Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
[17:13.30]	Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
[17:16.81]	No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
[17:19.87]	Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
[17:23.46]	Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
[17:27.57]	Into the market-place: there shall I try
[17:31.01]	In my oration, how the people take
[17:33.99]	The cruel issue of these bloody men;
[17:37.13]	According to the which, thou shalt discourse
[17:40.87]	To young Octavius of the state of things.
[17:44.38]	Lend me your hand.
[17:46.17]	[Exeunt with CAESAR's body]
