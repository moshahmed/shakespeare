[00:00.46]	[Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.,]
[00:01.38]	[Enter BRUTUS]
[00:02.30]BRUTUS	What, Lucius, ho!
[00:03.92]	I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
[00:07.31]	Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
[00:10.85]	I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
[00:14.77]	When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
[00:18.39]	[Enter LUCIUS]
[00:19.31]LUCIUS	Call'd you, my lord?
[00:21.24]BRUTUS	Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
[00:24.31]	When it is lighted, come and call me here.
[00:27.93]LUCIUS	I will, my lord.
[00:29.55]	[Exit]
[00:30.47]BRUTUS	It must be by his death: and for my part,
[00:34.01]	I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
[00:37.63]	But for the general. He would be crown'd:
[00:41.17]	How that might change his nature, there's the question.
[00:45.78]	It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
[00:50.02]	And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
[00:53.87]	And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
[00:57.33]	That at his will he may do danger with.
[01:00.79]	The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
[01:04.56]	Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
[01:08.72]	I have not known when his affections sway'd
[01:12.57]	More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
[01:16.41]	That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
[01:20.11]	Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
[01:23.80]	But when he once attains the upmost round.
[01:27.50]	He then unto the ladder turns his back,
[01:30.96]	Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
[01:34.96]	By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
[01:38.27]	Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
[01:42.35]	Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
[01:45.89]	Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
[01:49.58]	Would run to these and these extremities:
[01:53.20]	And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
[01:56.97]	Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
[02:01.20]	And kill him in the shell.
[02:03.67]	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
[02:04.59]LUCIUS	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
[02:07.90]	Searching the window for a flint, I found
[02:11.52]	This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
[02:15.06]	It did not lie there when I went to bed.
[02:18.60]	[Gives him the letter]
[02:19.52]BRUTUS	Get you to bed again; it is not day.
[02:22.67]	Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
[02:26.14]LUCIUS	I know not, sir.
[02:27.75]BRUTUS	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
[02:31.22]LUCIUS	I will, sir.
[02:32.52]	[Exit]
[02:33.45]BRUTUS	The exhalations whizzing in the air
[02:36.68]	Give so much light that I may read by them.
[02:40.45]	[Opens the letter and reads]
[02:41.37]	'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
[02:45.15]	Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!
[02:48.22]	Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
[02:50.76]	Such instigations have been often dropp'd
[02:54.46]	Where I have took them up.
[02:56.92]	'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out:
[03:00.31]	Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
[03:04.39]	My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
[03:08.08]	The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
[03:11.93]	'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
[03:15.16]	To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
[03:19.24]	If the redress will follow, thou receivest
[03:22.93]	Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
[03:26.47]	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
[03:27.40]LUCIUS	Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
[03:30.47]	[Knocking within]
[03:31.40]BRUTUS	'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
[03:34.94]	[Exit LUCIUS]
[03:35.86]	Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
[03:39.94]	I have not slept.
[03:41.71]	Between the acting of a dreadful thing
[03:45.17]	And the first motion, all the interim is
[03:48.71]	Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
[03:51.94]	The Genius and the mortal instruments
[03:55.33]	Are then in council; and the state of man,
[03:58.95]	Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
[04:02.33]	The nature of an insurrection.
[04:05.10]	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
[04:06.03]LUCIUS	Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
[04:09.65]	Who doth desire to see you.
[04:12.18]BRUTUS	Is he alone?
[04:13.57]LUCIUS	No, sir, there are moe with him.
[04:16.34]BRUTUS	Do you know them?
[04:18.11]LUCIUS	No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
[04:22.19]	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
[04:26.04]	That by no means I may discover them
[04:29.35]	By any mark of favour.
[04:31.50]BRUTUS	Let 'em enter.
[04:32.96]	[Exit LUCIUS]
[04:33.89]	They are the faction. O conspiracy,
[04:36.96]	Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
[04:41.20]	When evils are most free? O, then by day
[04:44.66]	Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
[04:48.35]	To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
[04:52.66]	Hide it in smiles and affability:
[04:55.67]	For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
[04:59.28]	Not Erebus itself were dim enough
[05:02.36]	To hide thee from prevention.
[05:05.05]	[Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS
[05:08.90]	+ BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS]
[05:12.67]CASSIUS	I think we are too bold upon your rest:
[05:16.14]	Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
[05:19.45]BRUTUS	I have been up this hour, awake all night.
[05:23.06]	Know I these men that come along with you?
[05:26.76]CASSIUS	Yes, every man of them, and no man here
[05:30.14]	But honours you; and every one doth wish
[05:33.68]	You had but that opinion of yourself
[05:36.99]	Which every noble Roman bears of you.
[05:40.30]	This is Trebonius.
[05:42.15]BRUTUS	He is welcome hither.
[05:44.23]CASSIUS	This, Decius Brutus.
[05:46.15]BRUTUS	He is welcome too.
[05:48.00]CASSIUS	This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
[05:52.08]BRUTUS	They are all welcome.
[05:54.15]	What watchful cares do interpose themselves
[05:58.00]	Betwixt your eyes and night?
[06:00.62]CASSIUS	Shall I entreat a word?
[06:02.85]	[BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper]
[06:03.77]DECIUS BRUTUS	Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
[06:07.85]CASCA	No.
[06:08.54]CINNA	O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
[06:12.08]	That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
[06:15.86]CASCA	You shall confess that you are both deceived.
[06:19.78]	Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
[06:23.32]	Which is a great way growing on the south,
[06:27.01]	Weighing the youthful season of the year.
[06:30.63]	Some two months hence up higher toward the north
[06:34.86]	He first presents his fire; and the high east
[06:38.79]	Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
[06:42.02]BRUTUS	Give me your hands all over, one by one.
[06:45.48]CASSIUS	And let us swear our resolution.
[06:48.41]BRUTUS	No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
[06:51.79]	The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
[06:55.72]	If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
[06:59.49]	And every man hence to his idle bed;
[07:02.72]	So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
[07:06.03]	Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
[07:09.80]	As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
[07:13.19]	To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
[07:16.96]	The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
[07:20.88]	What need we any spur but our own cause,
[07:24.42]	To prick us to redress? what other bond
[07:27.89]	Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
[07:31.74]	And will not palter? and what other oath
[07:35.28]	Than honesty to honesty engaged,
[07:38.20]	That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
[07:41.89]	Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
[07:45.74]	Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
[07:49.67]	That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
[07:53.36]	Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
[07:57.29]	The even virtue of our enterprise,
[08:00.36]	Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
[08:04.21]	To think that or our cause or our performance
[08:08.21]	Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
[08:11.91]	That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
[08:15.37]	Is guilty of a several bastardy,
[08:18.29]	If he do break the smallest particle
[08:21.60]	Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
[08:25.22]CASSIUS	But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
[08:28.61]	I think he will stand very strong with us.
[08:32.30]CASCA	Let us not leave him out.
[08:34.69]CINNA	No, by no means.
[08:36.30]METELLUS CIMBER	O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
[08:39.77]	Will purchase us a good opinion
[08:42.69]	And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
[08:46.38]	It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
[08:50.39]	Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
[08:54.31]	But all be buried in his gravity.
[08:57.31]BRUTUS	O, name him not: let us not break with him;
[09:00.93]	For he will never follow any thing
[09:04.08]	That other men begin.
[09:06.16]CASSIUS	Then leave him out.
[09:08.09]CASCA	Indeed he is not fit.
[09:10.16]DECIUS BRUTUS	Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
[09:14.09]CASSIUS	Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
[09:17.71]	Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
[09:21.09]	Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
[09:24.86]	A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
[09:28.56]	If he improve them, may well stretch so far
[09:32.33]	As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
[09:35.56]	Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
[09:38.79]BRUTUS	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
[09:42.79]	To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
[09:46.64]	Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
[09:50.18]	For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
[09:53.34]	Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
[09:57.26]	We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
[10:01.19]	And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
[10:04.96]	O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
[10:08.88]	And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
[10:11.96]	Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
[10:15.81]	Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
[10:19.43]	Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
[10:23.20]	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
[10:26.74]	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
[10:30.28]	Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
[10:33.89]	And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
[10:37.66]	Our purpose necessary and not envious:
[10:41.05]	Which so appearing to the common eyes,
[10:44.44]	We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
[10:48.05]	And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
[10:51.36]	For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
[10:54.90]	When Caesar's head is off.
[10:57.37]CASSIUS	Yet I fear him;
[10:58.98]	For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
[11:02.91]BRUTUS	Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
[11:06.29]	If he love Caesar, all that he can do
[11:09.60]	Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
[11:13.60]	And that were much he should; for he is given
[11:17.53]	To sports, to wildness and much company.
[11:20.99]TREBONIUS	There is no fear in him; let him not die;
[11:24.53]	For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
[11:28.46]	[Clock strikes]
[11:29.38]BRUTUS	Peace! count the clock.
[11:31.53]CASSIUS	The clock hath stricken three.
[11:34.31]TREBONIUS	'Tis time to part.
[11:36.08]CASSIUS	But it is doubtful yet,
[11:38.31]	Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
[11:42.15]	For he is superstitious grown of late,
[11:45.54]	Quite from the main opinion he held once
[11:49.16]	Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
[11:52.39]	It may be, these apparent prodigies,
[11:55.55]	The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
[11:58.93]	And the persuasion of his augurers,
[12:02.09]	May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
[12:05.40]DECIUS BRUTUS	Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
[12:08.71]	I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
[12:12.25]	That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
[12:15.86]	And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
[12:19.71]	Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
[12:23.33]	But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
[12:26.87]	He says he does, being then most flattered.
[12:30.56]	Let me work;
[12:31.95]	For I can give his humour the true bent,
[12:35.49]	And I will bring him to the Capitol.
[12:38.72]CASSIUS	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
[12:42.57]BRUTUS	By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
[12:46.18]CINNA	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
[12:49.72]METELLUS CIMBER	Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
[12:53.03]	Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
[12:56.73]	I wonder none of you have thought of him.
[13:00.34]BRUTUS	Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
[13:03.42]	He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
[13:07.42]	Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
[13:11.04]CASSIUS	The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
[13:15.20]	And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
[13:19.43]	What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
[13:23.82]BRUTUS	Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
[13:27.20]	Let not our looks put on our purposes,
[13:30.59]	But bear it as our Roman actors do,
[13:33.74]	With untired spirits and formal constancy:
[13:37.44]	And so good morrow to you every one.
[13:40.67]	[Exeunt all but BRUTUS]
[13:41.59]	Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
[13:45.06]	Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
[13:48.37]	Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
[13:51.75]	Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
[13:55.52]	Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
[13:58.52]	[Enter PORTIA]
[13:59.45]PORTIA	Brutus, my lord!
[14:01.06]BRUTUS	Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
[14:04.91]	It is not for your health thus to commit
[14:08.53]	Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
[14:12.38]PORTIA	Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
[14:16.30]	Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
[14:20.15]	You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
[14:23.38]	Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
[14:27.00]	And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
[14:30.61]	You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
[14:34.08]	I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
[14:38.31]	And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
[14:42.08]	Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
[14:45.31]	But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
[14:48.78]	Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
[14:52.24]	Fearing to strengthen that impatience
[14:55.63]	Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
[14:59.40]	Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
[15:02.78]	Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
[15:06.63]	It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
[15:10.40]	And could it work so much upon your shape
[15:14.10]	As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
[15:17.94]	I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
[15:21.64]	Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
[15:25.49]BRUTUS	I am not well in health, and that is all.
[15:29.03]PORTIA	Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
[15:32.64]	He would embrace the means to come by it.
[15:36.26]BRUTUS	Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
[15:39.34]PORTIA	Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
[15:42.42]	To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
[15:46.03]	Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
[15:49.57]	And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
[15:53.34]	To dare the vile contagion of the night
[15:56.88]	And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
[16:00.27]	To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
[16:03.66]	You have some sick offence within your mind,
[16:07.50]	Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
[16:11.20]	I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
[16:14.51]	I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
[16:18.05]	By all your vows of love and that great vow
[16:21.90]	Which did incorporate and make us one,
[16:25.28]	That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
[16:28.90]	Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
[16:32.44]	Have had to resort to you: for here have been
[16:36.36]	Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
[16:40.13]	Even from darkness.
[16:42.06]BRUTUS	Kneel not, gentle Portia.
[16:44.37]PORTIA	I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
[16:48.21]	Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
[16:51.99]	Is it excepted I should know no secrets
[16:55.53]	That appertain to you? Am I yourself
[16:58.76]	But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
[17:02.07]	To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
[17:05.84]	And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
[17:10.38]	Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
[17:13.84]	Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
[17:17.15]BRUTUS	You are my true and honourable wife,
[17:20.38]	As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
[17:23.69]	That visit my sad heart
[17:26.00]PORTIA	If this were true, then should I know this secret.
[17:30.23]	I grant I am a woman; but withal
[17:33.16]	A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
[17:36.54]	I grant I am a woman; but withal
[17:39.47]	A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
[17:42.78]	Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
[17:46.24]	Being so father'd and so husbanded?
[17:49.40]	Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
[17:53.32]	I have made strong proof of my constancy,
[17:56.94]	Giving myself a voluntary wound
[17:59.86]	Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
[18:04.02]	And not my husband's secrets?
[18:06.71]BRUTUS	O ye gods,
[18:07.94]	Render me worthy of this noble wife!
[18:11.17]	[Knocking within]
[18:12.10]	Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
[18:15.72]	And by and by thy bosom shall partake
[18:19.10]	The secrets of my heart.
[18:21.41]	All my engagements I will construe to thee,
[18:25.18]	All the charactery of my sad brows:
[18:28.34]	Leave me with haste.
[18:30.34]	[Exit PORTIA]
[18:31.26]	Lucius, who's that knocks?
[18:33.65]	[Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS]
[18:34.57]LUCIUS	He is a sick man that would speak with you.
[18:38.34]BRUTUS	Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
[18:41.73]	Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
[18:44.88]LIGARIUS	Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
[18:48.65]BRUTUS	O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
[18:52.58]	To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
[18:56.35]LIGARIUS	I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
[18:59.66]	Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
[19:03.04]BRUTUS	Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
[19:06.58]	Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
[19:09.97]LIGARIUS	By all the gods that Romans bow before,
[19:13.43]	I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
[19:16.97]	Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
[19:20.51]	Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
[19:23.98]	My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
[19:27.13]	And I will strive with things impossible;
[19:30.75]	Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
[19:34.29]BRUTUS	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
[19:38.29]LIGARIUS	But are not some whole that we must make sick?
[19:42.29]BRUTUS	That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
[19:45.68]	I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
[19:49.14]	To whom it must be done.
[19:51.45]LIGARIUS	Set on your foot,
[19:53.22]	And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
[19:56.76]	To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
[20:00.22]	That Brutus leads me on.
[20:02.53]BRUTUS	Follow me, then.
[20:04.15]	[Exeunt]
