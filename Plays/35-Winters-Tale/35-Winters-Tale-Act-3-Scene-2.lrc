[00:00.47]	[A court of Justice.,]
[00:01.43]	[Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers]
[00:02.38]LEONTES	This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
[00:06.51]	Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
[00:10.57]	The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
[00:14.22]	Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
[00:17.96]	Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
[00:21.45]	Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
[00:25.67]	Even to the guilt or the purgation.
[00:28.92]	Produce the prisoner.
[00:31.07]Officer	It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
[00:34.96]	Appear in person here in court. Silence!
[00:38.54]	[Enter HERMIONE guarded;
[00:39.02]	+ PAULINA and Ladies attending]
[00:39.49]LEONTES	Read the indictment.
[00:41.56]Officer	[Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthy
[00:44.82]	Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and
[00:49.27]	arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
[00:53.64]	with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring
[00:57.77]	with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
[01:02.38]	lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence
[01:06.44]	whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,
[01:10.73]	thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance
[01:15.26]	of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for
[01:19.63]	their better safety, to fly away by night.
[01:23.37]HERMIONE	Since what I am to say must be but that
[01:27.02]	Which contradicts my accusation and
[01:30.36]	The testimony on my part no other
[01:33.54]	But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
[01:38.07]	To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
[01:41.17]	Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
[01:45.30]	Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
[01:49.04]	Behold our human actions, as they do,
[01:52.37]	I doubt not then but innocence shall make
[01:56.19]	False accusation blush and tyranny
[01:59.45]	Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
[02:03.26]	Who least will seem to do so, my past life
[02:07.08]	Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
[02:10.81]	As I am now unhappy; which is more
[02:13.99]	Than history can pattern, though devised
[02:17.65]	And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
[02:21.62]	A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
[02:24.96]	A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
[02:29.17]	The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
[02:33.22]	To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
[02:37.12]	Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
[02:41.41]	As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
[02:45.70]	'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
[02:48.80]	And only that I stand for. I appeal
[02:52.06]	To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
[02:56.03]	Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
[02:59.93]	How merited to be so; since he came,
[03:03.19]	With what encounter so uncurrent I
[03:06.45]	Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
[03:10.66]	The bound of honour, or in act or will
[03:14.15]	That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
[03:17.97]	Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
[03:21.78]	Cry fie upon my grave!
[03:24.01]LEONTES	I ne'er heard yet
[03:25.92]	That any of these bolder vices wanted
[03:29.41]	Less impudence to gainsay what they did
[03:33.07]	Than to perform it first.
[03:35.53]HERMIONE	That's true enough;
[03:37.52]	Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
[03:41.10]LEONTES	You will not own it.
[03:43.16]HERMIONE	More than mistress of
[03:45.39]	Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
[03:49.52]	At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
[03:52.62]	With whom I am accused, I do confess
[03:55.96]	I loved him as in honour he required,
[03:59.38]	With such a kind of love as might become
[04:03.11]	A lady like me, with a love even such,
[04:06.53]	So and no other, as yourself commanded:
[04:10.03]	Which not to have done I think had been in me
[04:14.16]	Both disobedience and ingratitude
[04:17.34]	To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
[04:21.87]	Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
[04:26.16]	That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
[04:29.58]	I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
[04:33.63]	For me to try how: all I know of it
[04:36.89]	Is that Camillo was an honest man;
[04:40.07]	And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
[04:44.28]	Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
[04:47.62]LEONTES	You knew of his departure, as you know
[04:51.11]	What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
[04:55.09]HERMIONE	Sir,
[04:55.88]	You speak a language that I understand not:
[04:59.78]	My life stands in the level of your dreams,
[05:03.67]	Which I'll lay down.
[05:05.74]LEONTES	Your actions are my dreams;
[05:08.36]	You had a bastard by Polixenes,
[05:11.30]	And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
[05:15.59]	Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
[05:19.57]	Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
[05:23.78]	Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
[05:27.67]	No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
[05:31.01]	More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
[05:34.51]	Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
[05:38.80]	Look for no less than death.
[05:41.50]HERMIONE	Sir, spare your threats:
[05:43.81]	The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
[05:47.94]	To me can life be no commodity:
[05:50.88]	The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
[05:54.93]	I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
[05:58.35]	But know not how it went. My second joy
[06:01.93]	And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
[06:06.06]	I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
[06:10.43]	Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
[06:14.17]	The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
[06:18.22]	Haled out to murder: myself on every post
[06:21.96]	Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
[06:25.85]	The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
[06:29.74]	To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
[06:33.32]	Here to this place, i' the open air, before
[06:37.06]	I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
[06:40.87]	Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
[06:44.61]	That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
[06:48.58]	But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
[06:52.32]	I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
[06:56.21]	Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
[07:00.10]	Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
[07:03.68]	But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
[07:07.50]	'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
[07:11.07]	I do refer me to the oracle:
[07:13.77]	Apollo be my judge!
[07:15.76]First Lord	This your request
[07:17.67]	Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
[07:21.40]	And in Apollos name, his oracle.
[07:24.34]	[Exeunt certain Officers]
[07:25.30]HERMIONE	The Emperor of Russia was my father:
[07:28.64]	O that he were alive, and here beholding
[07:32.29]	His daughter's trial! that he did but see
[07:36.03]	The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
[07:39.68]	Of pity, not revenge!
[07:41.75]	[Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION]
[07:42.70]Officer	You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
[07:47.00]	That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
[07:50.09]	Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
[07:54.55]	The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
[07:58.44]	Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
[08:02.49]	You have not dared to break the holy seal
[08:06.31]	Nor read the secrets in't.
[08:08.85]CLEOMENES	|
[08:09.33]	|	All this we swear.
[08:11.24]DION	|
[08:11.71]LEONTES	Break up the seals and read.
[08:14.41]Officer	[Reads]
[08:15.37]	Hermione is chaste;
[08:17.35]	Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes
[08:21.88]	a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;
[08:26.34]	and the king shall live without an heir, if that
[08:30.63]	which is lost be not found.
[08:33.25]Lords	Now blessed be the great Apollo!
[08:36.27]HERMIONE	Praised!
[08:37.38]LEONTES	Hast thou read truth?
[08:39.53]Officer	Ay, my lord; even so
[08:41.52]	As it is here set down.
[08:43.82]LEONTES	There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
[08:47.32]	The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
[08:51.77]	[Enter Servant]
[08:52.72]Servant	My lord the king, the king!
[08:55.26]LEONTES	What is the business?
[08:57.41]Servant	O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
[09:00.75]	The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
[09:04.96]	Of the queen's speed, is gone.
[09:07.74]LEONTES	How! gone!
[09:08.93]Servant	Is dead.
[09:10.05]LEONTES	Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
[09:13.86]	Do strike at my injustice.
[09:16.41]	[HERMIONE swoons]
[09:17.36]	How now there!
[09:18.95]PAULINA	This news is mortal to the queen: look down
[09:22.84]	And see what death is doing.
[09:25.55]LEONTES	Take her hence:
[09:27.21]	Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
[09:31.35]	I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
[09:35.32]	Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
[09:38.50]	Some remedies for life.
[09:40.80]	[Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE]
[09:41.76]	Apollo, pardon
[09:43.35]	My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
[09:47.08]	I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
[09:50.02]	New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
[09:53.76]	Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
[09:57.41]	For, being transported by my jealousies
[10:00.99]	To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
[10:04.81]	Camillo for the minister to poison
[10:08.06]	My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
[10:11.72]	But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
[10:15.54]	My swift command, though I with death and with
[10:19.67]	Reward did threaten and encourage him,
[10:23.17]	Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
[10:26.98]	And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
[10:30.79]	Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
[10:34.85]	Which you knew great, and to the hazard
[10:38.42]	Of all encertainties himself commended,
[10:42.00]	No richer than his honour: how he glisters
[10:45.82]	Thorough my rust! and how his pity
[10:48.99]	Does my deeds make the blacker!
[10:51.94]	[Re-enter PAULINA]
[10:52.89]PAULINA	Woe the while!
[10:54.48]	O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
[10:58.13]	Break too.
[10:59.41]First Lord	What fit is this, good lady?
[11:02.03]PAULINA	What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
[11:05.76]	What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
[11:09.82]	In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
[11:13.71]	Must I receive, whose every word deserves
[11:17.45]	To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
[11:21.02]	Together working with thy jealousies,
[11:24.44]	Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
[11:28.49]	For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
[11:32.63]	And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
[11:36.44]	Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
[11:40.42]	That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
[11:44.39]	That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
[11:48.36]	And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
[11:51.94]	Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
[11:56.31]	To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
[11:59.97]	More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
[12:03.94]	The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
[12:07.99]	To be or none or little; though a devil
[12:11.57]	Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
[12:15.62]	Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
[12:19.36]	Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
[12:23.49]	Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
[12:27.78]	That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
[12:31.84]	Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
[12:35.65]	Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
[12:39.31]	When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
[12:43.36]	The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
[12:46.78]	and vengeance for't
[12:48.84]	Not dropp'd down yet.
[12:50.99]First Lord	The higher powers forbid!
[12:53.45]PAULINA	I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
[12:57.67]	Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
[13:01.32]	Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
[13:04.82]	Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
[13:09.03]	As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
[13:12.77]	Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
[13:17.06]	Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
[13:21.43]	To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
[13:25.09]	Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
[13:28.90]	Upon a barren mountain and still winter
[13:32.56]	In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
[13:36.45]	To look that way thou wert.
[13:39.07]LEONTES	Go on, go on
[13:40.50]	Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
[13:44.64]	All tongues to talk their bitterest.
[13:47.97]First Lord	Say no more:
[13:49.40]	Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
[13:53.54]	I' the boldness of your speech.
[13:56.40]PAULINA	I am sorry for't:
[13:58.23]	All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
[14:02.60]	I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
[14:06.25]	The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
[14:09.75]	To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
[14:14.36]	Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
[14:18.57]	At my petition; I beseech you, rather
[14:21.91]	Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
[14:25.57]	Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
[14:29.54]	Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
[14:33.04]	The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
[14:36.77]	I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
[14:40.98]	I'll not remember you of my own lord,
[14:44.40]	Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
[14:48.22]	And I'll say nothing.
[14:50.36]LEONTES	Thou didst speak but well
[14:52.91]	When most the truth; which I receive much better
[14:57.20]	Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
[15:01.09]	To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
[15:04.67]	One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
[15:08.64]	The causes of their death appear, unto
[15:12.14]	Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
[15:15.95]	The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
[15:20.17]	Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
[15:23.90]	Will bear up with this exercise, so long
[15:27.56]	I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
[15:31.13]	Unto these sorrows.
[15:33.12]	[Exeunt]
