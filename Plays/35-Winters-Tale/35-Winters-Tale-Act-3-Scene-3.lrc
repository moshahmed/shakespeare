[00:00.45]	[Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.,]
[00:01.35]	[Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner]
[00:02.26]ANTIGONUS	Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
[00:06.42]	The deserts of Bohemia?
[00:08.61]Mariner	Ay, my lord: and fear
[00:10.57]	We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
[00:14.73]	And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
[00:18.73]	The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
[00:22.81]	And frown upon 's.
[00:24.55]ANTIGONUS	Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
[00:28.10]	Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
[00:31.65]	I call upon thee.
[00:33.39]Mariner	Make your best haste, and go not
[00:36.26]	Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
[00:40.26]	Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
[00:44.27]	Of prey that keep upon't.
[00:46.61]ANTIGONUS	Go thou away:
[00:48.04]	I'll follow instantly.
[00:50.16]Mariner	I am glad at heart
[00:52.05]	To be so rid o' the business.
[00:54.62]	[Exit]
[00:55.52]ANTIGONUS	Come, poor babe:
[00:57.11]	I have heard, but not believed,
[00:59.83]	the spirits o' the dead
[01:02.02]	May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
[01:05.72]	Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
[01:09.65]	So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
[01:13.13]	Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
[01:16.90]	I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
[01:20.08]	So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
[01:24.01]	Like very sanctity, she did approach
[01:27.18]	My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
[01:30.96]	And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
[01:34.58]	Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
[01:37.91]	Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
[01:41.31]	Since fate, against thy better disposition,
[01:44.93]	Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
[01:48.48]	Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
[01:51.96]	Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
[01:55.13]	There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
[01:59.21]	Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
[02:02.16]	I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
[02:05.93]	Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
[02:09.71]	Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
[02:13.34]	She melted into air. Affrighted much,
[02:16.51]	I did in time collect myself and thought
[02:20.06]	This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
[02:23.76]	Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
[02:27.09]	I will be squared by this. I do believe
[02:30.49]	Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
[02:33.81]	Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
[02:37.36]	Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
[02:40.91]	Either for life or death, upon the earth
[02:44.39]	Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
[02:48.17]	There lie, and there thy character: there these;
[02:52.10]	Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
[02:56.40]	And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
[03:00.63]	That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
[03:04.49]	To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
[03:08.11]	But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
[03:11.81]	To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
[03:15.29]	The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
[03:19.52]	A lullaby too rough: I never saw
[03:22.39]	The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
[03:26.09]	Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
[03:29.57]	I am gone for ever.
[03:31.46]	[Exit, pursued by a bear]
[03:32.36]	[Enter a Shepherd]
[03:33.27]Shepherd	I would there were no age between sixteen and
[03:37.20]	three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
[03:41.50]	rest; for there is nothing in the between but
[03:45.36]	getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
[03:49.59]	stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
[03:53.44]	these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
[03:57.75]	hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
[04:01.98]	best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
[04:06.21]	than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
[04:10.29]	the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
[04:14.52]	will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
[04:18.67]	pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
[04:22.22]	pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
[04:26.08]	though I am not bookish, yet I can read
[04:29.48]	waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
[04:33.48]	some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
[04:36.73]	behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
[04:40.81]	than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
[04:44.89]	pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
[04:49.04]	but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!
[04:51.39]	[Enter Clown]
[04:52.29]Clown	Hilloa, loa!
[04:53.58]Shepherd	What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
[04:57.66]	on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
[05:01.89]	ailest thou, man?
[05:03.55]Clown	I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
[05:07.55]	but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
[05:11.79]	sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
[05:16.09]	a bodkin's point.
[05:17.83]Shepherd	Why, boy, how is it?
[05:19.64]Clown	I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
[05:23.95]	how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
[05:27.80]	point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
[05:31.81]	sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
[05:35.73]	ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
[05:39.89]	swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
[05:44.04]	cork into a hogshead. And then for the
[05:47.37]	land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
[05:51.30]	shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
[05:55.60]	his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
[05:59.76]	end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
[06:03.91]	it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
[06:07.92]	sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
[06:12.15]	and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
[06:16.30]	the sea or weather.
[06:18.19]Shepherd	Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
[06:21.06]Clown	Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
[06:24.84]	sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
[06:28.92]	the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
[06:33.00]	now.
[06:33.76]Shepherd	Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
[06:37.76]Clown	I would you had been by the ship side, to have
[06:41.69]	helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
[06:46.37]Shepherd	Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
[06:50.38]	boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
[06:54.38]	dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
[06:58.38]	thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
[07:02.31]	child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
[07:05.86]	open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
[07:09.87]	rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
[07:13.65]	open't. What's within, boy?
[07:15.99]Clown	You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
[07:20.07]	are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!
[07:24.37]Shepherd	This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
[07:28.23]	with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
[07:32.00]	We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
[07:35.86]	nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
[07:39.79]	boy, the next way home.
[07:41.90]Clown	Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
[07:46.21]	if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
[07:50.59]	he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
[07:54.74]	are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
[07:58.90]	it.
[07:59.58]Shepherd	That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
[08:03.81]	which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
[08:07.89]	sight of him.
[08:09.32]Clown	Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.
[08:14.01]Shepherd	'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.
[08:18.16]	[Exeunt]
