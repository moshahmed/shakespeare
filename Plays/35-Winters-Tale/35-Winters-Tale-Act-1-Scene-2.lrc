[00:00.41]	[A room of state in the same.,]
[00:01.23]	[Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS,
[00:01.64]	+ POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants]
[00:02.05]POLIXENES	Nine changes of the watery star hath been
[00:05.34]	The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
[00:09.18]	Without a burthen: time as long again
[00:12.13]	Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
[00:15.56]	And yet we should, for perpetuity,
[00:18.23]	Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
[00:21.73]	Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
[00:24.74]	With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
[00:27.96]	That go before it.
[00:29.61]LEONTES	Stay your thanks a while;
[00:31.74]	And pay them when you part.
[00:34.00]POLIXENES	Sir, that's to-morrow.
[00:35.85]	I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
[00:39.48]	Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
[00:42.64]	No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
[00:45.86]	'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
[00:49.70]	To tire your royalty.
[00:51.55]LEONTES	We are tougher, brother,
[00:53.54]	Than you can put us to't.
[00:55.66]POLIXENES	No longer stay.
[00:57.10]LEONTES	One seven-night longer.
[00:59.09]POLIXENES	Very sooth, to-morrow.
[01:00.94]LEONTES	We'll part the time between's then; and in that
[01:04.57]	I'll no gainsaying.
[01:06.29]POLIXENES	Press me not, beseech you, so.
[01:08.62]	There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
[01:12.59]	So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
[01:16.23]	Were there necessity in your request, although
[01:19.79]	'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
[01:22.74]	Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
[01:25.96]	Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
[01:29.05]	To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
[01:32.27]	Farewell, our brother.
[01:34.12]LEONTES	Tongue-tied, our queen?
[01:36.04]	speak you.
[01:37.13]HERMIONE	I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
[01:40.70]	You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
[01:44.54]	Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
[01:47.97]	All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
[01:51.12]	The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
[01:54.48]	He's beat from his best ward.
[01:56.88]LEONTES	Well said, Hermione.
[01:58.59]HERMIONE	To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
[02:02.02]	But let him say so then, and let him go;
[02:05.10]	But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
[02:08.46]	We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
[02:11.41]	Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
[02:14.70]	The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
[02:17.65]	You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
[02:21.15]	To let him there a month behind the gest
[02:24.37]	Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
[02:27.86]	I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
[02:31.09]	What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
[02:33.90]POLIXENES	No, madam.
[02:34.93]HERMIONE	Nay, but you will?
[02:36.50]POLIXENES	I may not, verily.
[02:38.08]HERMIONE	Verily!
[02:38.97]	You put me off with limber vows; but I,
[02:41.99]	Though you would seek to unsphere the
[02:45.00]	stars with oaths,
[02:46.58]	Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
[02:49.39]	You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
[02:52.20]	As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
[02:55.22]	Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
[02:58.03]	Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
[03:01.46]	When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
[03:05.23]	My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
[03:08.72]	One of them you shall be.
[03:10.85]POLIXENES	Your guest, then, madam:
[03:12.77]	To be your prisoner should import offending;
[03:16.19]	Which is for me less easy to commit
[03:19.07]	Than you to punish.
[03:20.79]HERMIONE	Not your gaoler, then,
[03:22.64]	But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
[03:26.13]	Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
[03:29.90]	You were pretty lordings then?
[03:32.37]POLIXENES	We were, fair queen,
[03:34.09]	Two lads that thought there was no more behind
[03:37.72]	But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
[03:40.53]	And to be boy eternal.
[03:42.45]HERMIONE	Was not my lord
[03:43.96]	The verier wag o' the two?
[03:46.08]POLIXENES	We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
[03:49.92]	And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
[03:53.56]	Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
[03:56.71]	The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
[03:59.73]	That any did. Had we pursued that life,
[04:02.74]	And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
[04:06.31]	With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
[04:10.21]	Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
[04:13.44]	Hereditary ours.
[04:14.94]HERMIONE	By this we gather
[04:16.59]	You have tripp'd since.
[04:18.58]POLIXENES	O my most sacred lady!
[04:20.50]	Temptations have since then been born to's; for
[04:24.13]	In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
[04:27.49]	Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
[04:31.26]	Of my young play-fellow.
[04:33.32]HERMIONE	Grace to boot!
[04:34.69]	Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
[04:37.84]	Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
[04:40.86]	The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
[04:44.42]	If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
[04:47.92]	You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
[04:51.62]	With any but with us.
[04:53.47]LEONTES	Is he won yet?
[04:54.84]HERMIONE	He'll stay my lord.
[04:56.56]LEONTES	At my request he would not.
[04:58.82]	Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
[05:01.90]	To better purpose.
[05:03.55]HERMIONE	Never?
[05:04.37]LEONTES	Never, but once.
[05:05.81]HERMIONE	What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
[05:09.38]	I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
[05:13.08]	As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
[05:17.12]	Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
[05:20.28]	Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
[05:23.50]	With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
[05:26.86]	With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
[05:30.15]	My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
[05:33.44]	What was my first? it has an elder sister,
[05:36.66]	Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
[05:40.16]	But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
[05:43.58]	Nay, let me have't; I long.
[05:45.71]LEONTES	Why, that was when
[05:47.35]	Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
[05:51.33]	Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
[05:54.62]	And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
[05:58.25]	'I am yours for ever.'
[06:00.04]HERMIONE	'Tis grace indeed.
[06:01.61]	Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
[06:05.38]	The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
[06:08.54]	The other for some while a friend.
[06:11.28]LEONTES	[Aside]
[06:12.10]	Too hot, too hot!
[06:13.61]	To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
[06:17.04]	I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
[06:20.40]	But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
[06:23.76]	May a free face put on, derive a liberty
[06:26.91]	From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
[06:30.20]	And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
[06:33.35]	But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
[06:36.92]	As now they are, and making practised smiles,
[06:40.35]	As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
[06:44.05]	The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
[06:47.47]	My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
[06:50.77]	Art thou my boy?
[06:52.27]MAMILLIUS	Ay, my good lord.
[06:53.78]LEONTES	I' fecks!
[06:54.74]	Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
[06:57.35]	smutch'd thy nose?
[06:58.99]	They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
[07:02.63]	We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
[07:06.12]	And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
[07:09.41]	Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
[07:12.50]	Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
[07:15.51]	Art thou my calf?
[07:17.09]MAMILLIUS	Yes, if you will, my lord.
[07:19.15]LEONTES	Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
[07:23.19]	To be full like me: yet they say we are
[07:26.28]	Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
[07:29.16]	That will say anything but were they false
[07:32.51]	As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
[07:35.94]	As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
[07:39.30]	No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
[07:42.80]	To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
[07:46.16]	Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
[07:49.72]	Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
[07:53.15]	Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
[07:56.37]	Thou dost make possible things not so held,
[07:59.73]	Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
[08:03.02]	With what's unreal thou coactive art,
[08:05.97]	And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
[08:09.40]	Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
[08:13.10]	And that beyond commission, and I find it,
[08:16.32]	And that to the infection of my brains
[08:19.40]	And hardening of my brows.
[08:21.60]POLIXENES	What means Sicilia?
[08:23.31]HERMIONE	He something seems unsettled.
[08:25.71]POLIXENES	How, my lord!
[08:26.95]	What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
[08:30.24]HERMIONE	You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
[08:34.14]	Are you moved, my lord?
[08:36.06]LEONTES	No, in good earnest.
[08:37.78]	How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
[08:41.14]	Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
[08:44.36]	To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
[08:47.37]	Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
[08:50.60]	Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
[08:54.09]	In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
[08:57.38]	Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
[09:00.81]	As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
[09:03.55]	How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
[09:07.05]	This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
[09:10.61]	Will you take eggs for money?
[09:13.01]MAMILLIUS	No, my lord, I'll fight.
[09:14.93]LEONTES	You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
[09:18.36]	Are you so fond of your young prince as we
[09:21.72]	Do seem to be of ours?
[09:23.64]POLIXENES	If at home, sir,
[09:25.08]	He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
[09:28.23]	Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
[09:31.39]	My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
[09:34.33]	He makes a July's day short as December,
[09:37.49]	And with his varying childness cures in me
[09:40.85]	Thoughts that would thick my blood.
[09:43.66]LEONTES	So stands this squire
[09:45.58]	Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
[09:48.80]	And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
[09:52.23]	How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
[09:56.00]	Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
[09:58.88]	Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
[10:02.03]	Apparent to my heart.
[10:03.88]HERMIONE	If you would seek us,
[10:05.73]	We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
[10:09.64]LEONTES	To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
[10:13.20]	Be you beneath the sky.
[10:15.19]	[Aside]
[10:16.01]	I am angling now,
[10:17.59]	Though you perceive me not how I give line.
[10:20.95]	Go to, go to!
[10:22.18]	How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
[10:25.41]	And arms her with the boldness of a wife
[10:28.63]	To her allowing husband!
[10:30.68]	[Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants]
[10:31.51]	Gone already!
[10:32.81]	Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
[10:35.62]	ears a fork'd one!
[10:37.27]	Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
[10:40.42]	Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
[10:43.91]	Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
[10:47.48]	Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
[10:50.22]	There have been,
[10:51.73]	Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
[10:54.81]	And many a man there is, even at this present,
[10:58.31]	Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
[11:02.08]	That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
[11:06.13]	And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
[11:09.62]	Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
[11:13.39]	Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
[11:17.30]	As mine, against their will. Should all despair
[11:20.86]	That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
[11:24.43]	Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
[11:28.20]	It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
[11:31.22]	Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
[11:34.92]	From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
[11:38.55]	No barricado for a belly; know't;
[11:41.16]	It will let in and out the enemy
[11:43.83]	With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
[11:46.98]	Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
[11:50.41]MAMILLIUS	I am like you, they say.
[11:52.40]LEONTES	Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
[11:55.76]CAMILLO	Ay, my good lord.
[11:57.27]LEONTES	Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
[12:00.42]	[Exit MAMILLIUS]
[12:01.24]	Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
[12:04.67]CAMILLO	You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
[12:07.89]	When you cast out, it still came home.
[12:10.84]LEONTES	Didst note it?
[12:12.21]CAMILLO	He would not stay at your petitions: made
[12:15.43]	His business more material.
[12:17.70]LEONTES	Didst perceive it?
[12:19.34]	[Aside]
[12:20.16]	They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
[12:23.93]	'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
[12:26.74]	When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
[12:30.24]	That he did stay?
[12:31.82]CAMILLO	At the good queen's entreaty.
[12:34.22]LEONTES	At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
[12:37.71]	But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
[12:40.73]	By any understanding pate but thine?
[12:43.61]	For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
[12:46.76]	More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
[12:50.12]	But of the finer natures? by some severals
[12:53.41]	Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
[12:56.63]	Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
[13:00.06]CAMILLO	Business, my lord! I think most understand
[13:03.28]	Bohemia stays here longer.
[13:05.48]LEONTES	Ha!
[13:06.09]CAMILLO	Stays here longer.
[13:07.74]LEONTES	Ay, but why?
[13:08.90]CAMILLO	To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
[13:12.33]	Of our most gracious mistress.
[13:14.80]LEONTES	Satisfy!
[13:15.76]	The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
[13:18.91]	Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
[13:22.41]	With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
[13:26.11]	My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
[13:29.61]	Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
[13:33.04]	Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
[13:36.12]	Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
[13:38.93]	In that which seems so.
[13:40.92]CAMILLO	Be it forbid, my lord!
[13:42.77]LEONTES	To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
[13:45.79]	If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
[13:49.28]	Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
[13:52.37]	From course required; or else thou must be counted
[13:56.21]	A servant grafted in my serious trust
[13:59.22]	And therein negligent; or else a fool
[14:02.17]	That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
[14:06.08]	And takest it all for jest.
[14:08.34]CAMILLO	My gracious lord,
[14:09.92]	I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
[14:13.00]	In every one of these no man is free,
[14:15.95]	But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
[14:19.03]	Among the infinite doings of the world,
[14:22.12]	Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
[14:25.55]	If ever I were wilful-negligent,
[14:28.15]	It was my folly; if industriously
[14:30.83]	I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
[14:33.91]	Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
[14:37.20]	To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
[14:40.35]	Where of the execution did cry out
[14:43.17]	Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
[14:46.32]	Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
[14:49.68]	Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
[14:52.97]	Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
[14:56.12]	Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
[14:59.48]	By its own visage: if I then deny it,
[15:02.36]	'Tis none of mine.
[15:03.94]LEONTES	Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
[15:05.99]	But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
[15:09.76]	Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
[15:13.05]	For to a vision so apparent rumour
[15:15.87]	Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
[15:19.09]	Resides not in that man that does not think,--
[15:22.51]	My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
[15:25.74]	Or else be impudently negative,
[15:28.27]	To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
[15:31.91]	My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
[15:35.06]	As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
[15:38.14]	Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
[15:41.57]CAMILLO	I would not be a stander-by to hear
[15:44.45]	My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
[15:47.67]	My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
[15:50.96]	You never spoke what did become you less
[15:54.19]	Than this; which to reiterate were sin
[15:57.20]	As deep as that, though true.
[15:59.53]LEONTES	Is whispering nothing?
[16:01.45]	Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
[16:04.81]	Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
[16:08.24]	Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
[16:11.53]	Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
[16:14.75]	Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
[16:18.32]	Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
[16:21.54]	Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
[16:25.38]	That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
[16:28.81]	Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
[16:32.64]	The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
[16:36.07]	My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
[16:39.98]	If this be nothing.
[16:41.69]CAMILLO	Good my lord, be cured
[16:43.61]	Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
[16:46.56]	For 'tis most dangerous.
[16:48.55]LEONTES	Say it be, 'tis true.
[16:50.26]CAMILLO	No, no, my lord.
[16:51.63]LEONTES	It is; you lie, you lie:
[16:53.55]	I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
[16:56.78]	Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
[17:00.27]	Or else a hovering temporizer, that
[17:03.08]	Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
[17:06.78]	Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
[17:10.21]	Infected as her life, she would not live
[17:13.37]	The running of one glass.
[17:15.49]CAMILLO	Who does infect her?
[17:17.27]LEONTES	Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
[17:20.63]	About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
[17:23.24]	Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
[17:26.53]	To see alike mine honour as their profits,
[17:29.82]	Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
[17:33.52]	Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
[17:36.74]	His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
[17:39.76]	Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
[17:43.53]	Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
[17:47.44]	How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
[17:50.45]	To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
[17:53.19]	Which draught to me were cordial.
[17:55.87]CAMILLO	Sir, my lord,
[17:57.10]	I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
[18:00.60]	But with a lingering dram that should not work
[18:04.23]	Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
[18:07.18]	Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
[18:10.74]	So sovereignly being honourable.
[18:13.35]	I have loved thee,--
[18:14.99]LEONTES	Make that thy question, and go rot!
[18:17.74]	Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
[18:20.75]	To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
[18:23.98]	The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
[18:26.99]	Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
[18:30.62]	Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
[18:33.71]	Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
[18:37.27]	Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
[18:40.43]	Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
[18:43.65]	Could man so blench?
[18:45.43]CAMILLO	I must believe you, sir:
[18:47.42]	I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
[18:50.44]	Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
[18:54.00]	Will take again your queen as yours at first,
[18:57.50]	Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
[19:01.27]	The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
[19:04.76]	Known and allied to yours.
[19:06.96]LEONTES	Thou dost advise me
[19:08.74]	Even so as I mine own course have set down:
[19:12.10]	I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
[19:15.25]CAMILLO	My lord,
[19:16.21]	Go then; and with a countenance as clear
[19:19.37]	As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
[19:23.07]	And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
[19:26.15]	If from me he have wholesome beverage,
[19:29.17]	Account me not your servant.
[19:31.50]LEONTES	This is all:
[19:32.73]	Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
[19:36.16]	Do't not, thou split'st thine own.
[19:38.84]CAMILLO	I'll do't, my lord.
[19:40.48]LEONTES	I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
[19:43.98]	[Exit]
[19:44.80]CAMILLO	O miserable lady! But, for me,
[19:47.13]	What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
[19:50.56]	Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
[19:53.71]	Is the obedience to a master, one
[19:56.38]	Who in rebellion with himself will have
[19:59.54]	All that are his so too. To do this deed,
[20:02.69]	Promotion follows. If I could find example
[20:05.98]	Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
[20:09.41]	And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
[20:12.91]	Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
[20:16.61]	Let villany itself forswear't. I must
[20:19.56]	Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
[20:22.91]	To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
[20:26.07]	Here comes Bohemia.
[20:27.78]	[Re-enter POLIXENES]
[20:28.60]POLIXENES	This is strange: methinks
[20:30.73]	My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
[20:33.88]	Good day, Camillo.
[20:35.46]CAMILLO	Hail, most royal sir!
[20:37.24]POLIXENES	What is the news i' the court?
[20:39.64]CAMILLO	None rare, my lord.
[20:41.29]POLIXENES	The king hath on him such a countenance
[20:44.44]	As he had lost some province and a region
[20:47.73]	Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
[20:51.23]	With customary compliment; when he,
[20:53.97]	Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
[20:57.47]	A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
[21:00.76]	So leaves me to consider what is breeding
[21:04.05]	That changeth thus his manners.
[21:06.58]CAMILLO	I dare not know, my lord.
[21:08.64]POLIXENES	How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
[21:12.14]	Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
[21:15.08]	For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
[21:18.37]	And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
[21:21.60]	Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
[21:25.02]	Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
[21:28.59]	A party in this alteration, finding
[21:31.40]	Myself thus alter'd with 't.
[21:33.66]CAMILLO	There is a sickness
[21:35.44]	Which puts some of us in distemper, but
[21:38.53]	I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
[21:41.89]	Of you that yet are well.
[21:44.01]POLIXENES	How! caught of me!
[21:45.59]	Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
[21:48.61]	I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
[21:52.58]	By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
[21:55.74]	As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
[21:58.96]	Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
[22:02.39]	Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
[22:05.54]	In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
[22:09.04]	If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
[22:12.81]	Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
[22:15.82]	In ignorant concealment.
[22:17.88]CAMILLO	I may not answer.
[22:19.46]POLIXENES	A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
[22:22.54]	I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
[22:25.83]	I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
[22:28.92]	Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
[22:32.62]	Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
[22:35.98]	What incidency thou dost guess of harm
[22:39.06]	Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
[22:42.42]	Which way to be prevented, if to be;
[22:45.23]	If not, how best to bear it.
[22:47.49]CAMILLO	Sir, I will tell you;
[22:49.28]	Since I am charged in honour and by him
[22:52.43]	That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
[22:56.27]	Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
[22:59.56]	I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
[23:02.92]	Cry lost, and so good night!
[23:05.18]POLIXENES	On, good Camillo.
[23:06.69]CAMILLO	I am appointed him to murder you.
[23:09.36]POLIXENES	By whom, Camillo?
[23:10.87]CAMILLO	By the king.
[23:12.10]POLIXENES	For what?
[23:13.13]CAMILLO	He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
[23:16.56]	As he had seen't or been an instrument
[23:19.64]	To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
[23:23.42]	Forbiddenly.
[23:24.65]POLIXENES	O, then my best blood turn
[23:26.84]	To an infected jelly and my name
[23:29.52]	Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
[23:32.88]	Turn then my freshest reputation to
[23:35.75]	A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
[23:39.25]	Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
[23:42.54]	Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
[23:46.24]	That e'er was heard or read!
[23:48.57]CAMILLO	Swear his thought over
[23:50.56]	By each particular star in heaven and
[23:53.58]	By all their influences, you may as well
[23:56.73]	Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
[23:59.61]	As or by oath remove or counsel shake
[24:02.63]	The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
[24:05.85]	Is piled upon his faith and will continue
[24:09.14]	The standing of his body.
[24:11.27]POLIXENES	How should this grow?
[24:13.12]CAMILLO	I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
[24:16.13]	Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
[24:19.70]	If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
[24:22.78]	That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
[24:26.14]	Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
[24:29.29]	Your followers I will whisper to the business,
[24:32.86]	And will by twos and threes at several posterns
[24:36.56]	Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
[24:39.85]	My fortunes to your service, which are here
[24:43.21]	By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
[24:46.36]	For, by the honour of my parents, I
[24:49.11]	Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
[24:52.67]	I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
[24:56.03]	Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
[24:59.94]	His execution sworn.
[25:01.72]POLIXENES	I do believe thee:
[25:03.37]	I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
[25:06.72]	Be pilot to me and thy places shall
[25:09.60]	Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
[25:13.03]	My people did expect my hence departure
[25:16.19]	Two days ago. This jealousy
[25:18.45]	Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
[25:21.67]	Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
[25:25.10]	Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
[25:28.46]	He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
[25:31.47]	Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
[25:34.56]	In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
[25:38.19]	Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
[25:41.41]	The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
[25:45.18]	Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
[25:48.34]	I will respect thee as a father if
[25:51.15]	Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
[25:54.57]CAMILLO	It is in mine authority to command
[25:57.39]	The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
[26:01.22]	To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
[26:04.24]	[Exeunt]
