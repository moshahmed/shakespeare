[00:00.36]	[A room in LEONTES' palace.,]
[00:01.10]	[Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants]
[00:01.84]LEONTES	Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
[00:04.99]	To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
[00:07.88]	The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
[00:11.03]	She the adulteress; for the harlot king
[00:13.80]	Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
[00:16.76]	And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
[00:19.65]	I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
[00:22.49]	Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
[00:25.20]	Might come to me again. Who's there?
[00:27.73]First Servant	My lord?
[00:28.59]LEONTES	How does the boy?
[00:30.01]First Servant	He took good rest to-night;
[00:32.04]	'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
[00:34.69]LEONTES	To see his nobleness!
[00:36.35]	Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
[00:39.13]	He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
[00:42.21]	Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
[00:45.35]	Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
[00:48.43]	And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
[00:51.51]	See how he fares.
[00:52.93]	[Exit Servant]
[00:53.67]	Fie, fie! no thought of him:
[00:55.64]	The thought of my revenges that way
[00:58.23]	Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
[01:00.88]	And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
[01:03.90]	Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
[01:07.04]	Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
[01:09.69]	Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
[01:12.77]	They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
[01:16.10]	Shall she within my power.
[01:18.07]	[Enter PAULINA, with a child]
[01:18.81]First Lord	You must not enter.
[01:20.35]PAULINA	Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
[01:23.25]	Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
[01:26.15]	Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
[01:29.41]	More free than he is jealous.
[01:31.57]ANTIGONUS	That's enough.
[01:32.80]Second Servant	Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
[01:35.76]	None should come at him.
[01:37.61]PAULINA	Not so hot, good sir:
[01:39.21]	I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
[01:42.17]	That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
[01:45.19]	At each his needless heavings, such as you
[01:48.15]	Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
[01:50.67]	Do come with words as medicinal as true,
[01:53.51]	Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
[01:56.65]	That presses him from sleep.
[01:58.75]LEONTES	What noise there, ho?
[02:00.35]PAULINA	No noise, my lord; but needful conference
[02:03.18]	About some gossips for your highness.
[02:05.83]LEONTES	How!
[02:06.45]	Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
[02:09.28]	I charged thee that she should not come about me:
[02:12.67]	I knew she would.
[02:14.09]ANTIGONUS	I told her so, my lord,
[02:15.82]	On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
[02:18.65]	She should not visit you.
[02:20.56]LEONTES	What, canst not rule her?
[02:22.41]PAULINA	From all dishonesty he can: in this,
[02:24.94]	Unless he take the course that you have done,
[02:28.08]	Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
[02:30.98]	He shall not rule me.
[02:32.64]ANTIGONUS	La you now, you hear:
[02:34.24]	When she will take the rein I let her run;
[02:37.20]	But she'll not stumble.
[02:38.99]PAULINA	Good my liege, I come;
[02:40.65]	And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
[02:43.36]	Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
[02:46.26]	Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
[02:49.34]	Less appear so in comforting your evils,
[02:52.18]	Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
[02:55.13]	From your good queen.
[02:56.80]LEONTES	Good queen!
[02:57.85]PAULINA	Good queen, my lord,
[02:59.39]	Good queen; I say good queen;
[03:01.48]	And would by combat make her good, so were I
[03:04.56]	A man, the worst about you.
[03:06.53]LEONTES	Force her hence.
[03:07.89]PAULINA	Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
[03:10.91]	First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
[03:13.87]	But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
[03:16.89]	For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
[03:20.34]	Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
[03:23.05]	[Laying down the child]
[03:23.79]LEONTES	Out!
[03:24.41]	A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
[03:27.36]	A most intelligencing bawd!
[03:29.40]PAULINA	Not so:
[03:30.20]	I am as ignorant in that as you
[03:32.54]	In so entitling me, and no less honest
[03:35.25]	Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
[03:38.46]	As this world goes, to pass for honest.
[03:41.17]LEONTES	Traitors!
[03:42.09]	Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
[03:45.36]	Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
[03:48.38]	By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
[03:51.52]	Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
[03:54.11]PAULINA	For ever
[03:55.03]	Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
[03:57.44]	Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
[04:00.70]	Which he has put upon't!
[04:02.55]LEONTES	He dreads his wife.
[04:04.09]PAULINA	So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
[04:07.24]	You'ld call your children yours.
[04:09.58]LEONTES	A nest of traitors!
[04:11.12]ANTIGONUS	I am none, by this good light.
[04:13.27]PAULINA	Nor I, nor any
[04:14.51]	But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
[04:17.71]	The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
[04:20.61]	His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
[04:23.94]	Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
[04:26.77]	and will not--
[04:27.94]	For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
[04:30.84]	He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
[04:33.67]	The root of his opinion, which is rotten
[04:36.51]	As ever oak or stone was sound.
[04:38.79]LEONTES	A callat
[04:39.71]	Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
[04:43.22]	And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
[04:46.24]	It is the issue of Polixenes:
[04:48.40]	Hence with it, and together with the dam
[04:51.24]	Commit them to the fire!
[04:53.08]PAULINA	It is yours;
[04:54.19]	And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
[04:57.52]	So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
[05:00.48]	Although the print be little, the whole matter
[05:03.68]	And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
[05:06.27]	The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
[05:09.66]	The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
[05:12.56]	His smiles,
[05:13.61]	The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
[05:16.75]	And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
[05:20.08]	So like to him that got it, if thou hast
[05:22.91]	The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
[05:26.24]	No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
[05:29.26]	Her children not her husband's!
[05:31.54]LEONTES	A gross hag
[05:32.65]	And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
[05:35.42]	That wilt not stay her tongue.
[05:37.64]ANTIGONUS	Hang all the husbands
[05:39.36]	That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
[05:42.63]	Hardly one subject.
[05:44.17]LEONTES	Once more, take her hence.
[05:46.08]PAULINA	A most unworthy and unnatural lord
[05:48.61]	Can do no more.
[05:49.90]LEONTES	I'll ha' thee burnt.
[05:51.44]PAULINA	I care not:
[05:52.49]	It is an heretic that makes the fire,
[05:55.14]	Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
[05:58.59]	But this most cruel usage of your queen,
[06:01.43]	Not able to produce more accusation
[06:04.02]	Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
[06:07.47]	Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
[06:10.12]	Yea, scandalous to the world.
[06:12.21]LEONTES	On your allegiance,
[06:13.75]	Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
[06:16.83]	Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
[06:19.98]	If she did know me one. Away with her!
[06:22.63]PAULINA	I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
[06:25.40]	Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
[06:27.99]	Jove send her
[06:29.22]	A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
[06:32.49]	You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
[06:35.63]	Will never do him good, not one of you.
[06:38.34]	So, so: farewell; we are gone.
[06:40.37]	[Exit]
[06:41.11]LEONTES	Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
[06:44.07]	My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
[06:46.97]	A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
[06:49.80]	And see it instantly consumed with fire;
[06:52.64]	Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
[06:55.97]	Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
[06:58.80]	And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
[07:01.94]	With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
[07:05.33]	And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
[07:08.17]	The bastard brains with these my proper hands
[07:11.37]	Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
[07:14.21]	For thou set'st on thy wife.
[07:16.30]ANTIGONUS	I did not, sir:
[07:17.53]	These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
[07:20.62]	Can clear me in't.
[07:22.09]Lords	We can: my royal liege,
[07:23.82]	He is not guilty of her coming hither.
[07:26.53]LEONTES	You're liars all.
[07:27.95]First Lord	Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
[07:31.03]	We have always truly served you, and beseech you
[07:34.36]	So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
[07:37.38]	As recompense of our dear services
[07:39.90]	Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
[07:43.29]	Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
[07:46.07]	Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
[07:48.90]LEONTES	I am a feather for each wind that blows:
[07:51.74]	Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
[07:54.69]	And call me father? better burn it now
[07:57.41]	Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
[08:00.30]	It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
[08:03.44]	You that have been so tenderly officious
[08:06.34]	With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
[08:08.99]	To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
[08:12.20]	So sure as this beard's grey,
[08:14.35]	--what will you adventure
[08:16.20]	To save this brat's life?
[08:18.11]ANTIGONUS	Any thing, my lord,
[08:19.59]	That my ability may undergo
[08:21.69]	And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
[08:24.52]	I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
[08:27.66]	To save the innocent: any thing possible.
[08:30.50]LEONTES	It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
[08:33.39]	Thou wilt perform my bidding.
[08:35.55]ANTIGONUS	I will, my lord.
[08:36.85]LEONTES	Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
[08:39.99]	Of any point in't shall not only be
[08:42.58]	Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
[08:45.78]	Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
[08:48.86]	As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
[08:51.94]	This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
[08:55.27]	To some remote and desert place quite out
[08:58.23]	Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
[09:01.43]	Without more mercy, to its own protection
[09:04.33]	And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
[09:07.66]	It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
[09:10.62]	On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
[09:13.64]	That thou commend it strangely to some place
[09:16.78]	Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
[09:19.86]ANTIGONUS	I swear to do this, though a present death
[09:22.82]	Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
[09:25.71]	Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
[09:29.23]	To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
[09:32.25]	Casting their savageness aside have done
[09:35.14]	Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
[09:37.92]	In more than this deed does require! And blessing
[09:41.31]	Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
[09:44.08]	Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!
[09:46.24]	[Exit with the child]
[09:46.97]LEONTES	No, I'll not rear
[09:48.39]	Another's issue.
[09:49.75]	[Enter a Servant]
[09:50.49]Servant	Please your highness, posts
[09:52.52]	From those you sent to the oracle are come
[09:55.54]	An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
[09:57.94]	Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
[10:01.27]	Hasting to the court.
[10:02.94]First Lord	So please you, sir, their speed
[10:05.15]	Hath been beyond account.
[10:07.06]LEONTES	Twenty-three days
[10:08.54]	They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
[10:11.81]	The great Apollo suddenly will have
[10:14.40]	The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
[10:17.42]	Summon a session, that we may arraign
[10:20.07]	Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
[10:22.84]	Been publicly accused, so shall she have
[10:25.68]	A just and open trial. While she lives
[10:28.39]	My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
[10:31.35]	And think upon my bidding.
[10:33.32]	[Exeunt]
