[00:00.38]	[The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.,]
[00:01.15]	[Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX,
[00:01.54]	+ MENELAUS, and CALCHAS]
[00:01.93]CALCHAS	Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
[00:05.14]	The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
[00:08.30]	To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
[00:11.64]	That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
[00:15.12]	I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
[00:18.15]	Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
[00:21.17]	From certain and possess'd conveniences,
[00:24.13]	To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
[00:27.48]	That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
[00:30.70]	Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
[00:33.72]	And here, to do you service, am become
[00:36.49]	As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
[00:39.64]	I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
[00:42.35]	To give me now a little benefit,
[00:44.79]	Out of those many register'd in promise,
[00:47.75]	Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
[00:50.71]AGAMEMNON	What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.
[00:53.87]CALCHAS	You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
[00:56.96]	Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
[00:59.92]	Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
[01:03.20]	Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
[01:06.35]	Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
[01:09.64]	I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
[01:12.60]	That their negotiations all must slack,
[01:15.49]	Wanting his manage; and they will almost
[01:18.46]	Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
[01:21.48]	In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
[01:24.89]	And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
[01:28.24]	Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
[01:31.65]	In most accepted pain.
[01:33.45]AGAMEMNON	Let Diomedes bear him,
[01:35.25]	And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
[01:38.67]	What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
[01:41.30]	Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
[01:44.27]	Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
[01:47.42]	Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
[01:50.57]DIOMEDES	This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
[01:53.53]	Which I am proud to bear.
[01:55.53]	[Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS]
[01:56.30]	[Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent]
[01:57.07]ULYSSES	Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
[02:00.23]	Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
[02:03.64]	As if he were forgot; and, princes all,
[02:06.41]	Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
[02:09.37]	I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
[02:12.59]	Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
[02:15.61]	If so, I have derision medicinable,
[02:18.19]	To use between your strangeness and his pride,
[02:21.53]	Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
[02:24.88]	It may be good: pride hath no other glass
[02:27.90]	To show itself but pride, for supple knees
[02:30.99]	Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
[02:34.21]AGAMEMNON	We'll execute your purpose, and put on
[02:37.04]	A form of strangeness as we pass along:
[02:39.94]	So do each lord, and either greet him not,
[02:42.97]	Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
[02:46.44]	Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
[02:49.53]ACHILLES	What, comes the general to speak with me?
[02:52.49]	You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
[02:55.97]AGAMEMNON	What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
[02:59.06]NESTOR	Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
[03:02.08]ACHILLES	No.
[03:02.66]NESTOR	Nothing, my lord.
[03:04.08]AGAMEMNON	The better.
[03:05.17]	[Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR]
[03:05.94]ACHILLES	Good day, good day.
[03:07.49]MENELAUS	How do you? how do you?
[03:09.29]	[Exit]
[03:10.06]ACHILLES	What, does the cuckold scorn me?
[03:12.44]AJAX	How now, Patroclus!
[03:13.99]ACHILLES	Good morrow, Ajax.
[03:15.47]AJAX	Ha?
[03:16.05]ACHILLES	Good morrow.
[03:17.21]AJAX	Ay, and good next day too.
[03:19.20]	[Exit]
[03:19.98]ACHILLES	What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
[03:23.39]PATROCLUS	They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
[03:26.73]	To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
[03:30.02]	To come as humbly as they used to creep
[03:32.98]	To holy altars.
[03:34.33]ACHILLES	What, am I poor of late?
[03:36.20]	'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
[03:39.86]	Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
[03:43.34]	He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
[03:46.56]	As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
[03:50.10]	Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
[03:53.38]	And not a man, for being simply man,
[03:56.02]	Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
[03:59.30]	That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
[04:02.52]	Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
[04:05.16]	Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
[04:08.63]	The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
[04:11.92]	Do one pluck down another and together
[04:14.81]	Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
[04:17.71]	Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
[04:20.48]	At ample point all that I did possess,
[04:23.31]	Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
[04:26.79]	Something not worth in me such rich beholding
[04:30.13]	As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
[04:33.16]	I'll interrupt his reading.
[04:35.28]	How now Ulysses!
[04:36.70]ULYSSES	Now, great Thetis' son!
[04:38.44]ACHILLES	What are you reading?
[04:40.17]ULYSSES	A strange fellow here
[04:41.98]	Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
[04:45.07]	How much in having, or without or in,
[04:47.77]	Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
[04:51.05]	Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
[04:54.33]	As when his virtues shining upon others
[04:57.29]	Heat them and they retort that heat again
[05:00.38]	To the first giver.'
[05:01.99]ACHILLES	This is not strange, Ulysses.
[05:04.18]	The beauty that is borne here in the face
[05:07.27]	The bearer knows not, but commends itself
[05:10.30]	To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
[05:13.19]	That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
[05:16.47]	Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
[05:19.76]	Salutes each other with each other's form;
[05:22.85]	For speculation turns not to itself,
[05:25.55]	Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
[05:28.83]	Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
[05:32.50]ULYSSES	I do not strain at the position,--
[05:34.95]	It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
[05:37.97]	Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
[05:41.00]	That no man is the lord of any thing,
[05:43.77]	Though in and of him there be much consisting,
[05:47.11]	Till he communicate his parts to others:
[05:50.07]	Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
[05:53.23]	Till he behold them form'd in the applause
[05:56.38]	Where they're extended; who, like an arch,
[05:59.34]	reverberates
[06:00.56]	The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
[06:03.53]	Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
[06:06.68]	His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;
[06:10.22]	And apprehended here immediately
[06:12.73]	The unknown Ajax.
[06:14.21]	Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
[06:17.23]	That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
[06:21.23]	Most abject in regard and dear in use!
[06:24.06]	What things again most dear in the esteem
[06:27.15]	And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
[06:30.43]	An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
[06:33.65]	Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
[06:36.67]	While some men leave to do!
[06:38.80]	How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
[06:42.14]	Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
[06:45.23]	How one man eats into another's pride,
[06:48.07]	While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
[06:51.09]	To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
[06:54.31]	They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
[06:57.40]	As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
[07:00.68]	And great Troy shrieking.
[07:02.68]ACHILLES	I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
[07:05.51]	As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
[07:08.66]	Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
[07:11.88]ULYSSES	Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
[07:14.78]	Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
[07:17.35]	A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
[07:20.18]	Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
[07:23.92]	As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
[07:26.88]	As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
[07:29.45]	Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
[07:32.67]	Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
[07:35.57]	In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
[07:38.72]	For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
[07:41.75]	Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
[07:45.09]	For emulation hath a thousand sons
[07:47.73]	That one by one pursue: if you give way,
[07:50.63]	Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
[07:53.72]	Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
[07:56.74]	And leave you hindmost;
[07:58.61]	Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
[08:01.89]	Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
[08:04.98]	O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
[08:08.84]	Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
[08:12.45]	For time is like a fashionable host
[08:15.15]	That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
[08:18.82]	And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
[08:22.23]	Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
[08:25.19]	And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
[08:28.15]	virtue seek
[08:29.31]	Remuneration for the thing it was;
[08:31.89]	For beauty, wit,
[08:33.24]	High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
[08:36.46]	Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
[08:39.48]	To envious and calumniating time.
[08:41.99]	One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
[08:45.34]	That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
[08:48.81]	Though they are made and moulded of things past,
[08:52.29]	And give to dust that is a little gilt
[08:55.19]	More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
[08:57.63]	The present eye praises the present object.
[09:00.78]	Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
[09:04.00]	That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
[09:07.09]	Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
[09:10.31]	Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
[09:13.66]	And still it might, and yet it may again,
[09:16.62]	If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
[09:19.64]	And case thy reputation in thy tent;
[09:22.35]	Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
[09:25.89]	Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
[09:29.43]	And drave great Mars to faction.
[09:31.87]ACHILLES	Of this my privacy
[09:33.48]	I have strong reasons.
[09:35.28]ULYSSES	But 'gainst your privacy
[09:37.22]	The reasons are more potent and heroical:
[09:40.24]	'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
[09:43.20]	With one of Priam's daughters.
[09:45.52]ACHILLES	Ha! known!
[09:46.48]ULYSSES	Is that a wonder?
[09:47.96]	The providence that's in a watchful state
[09:51.05]	Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
[09:54.01]	Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
[09:57.10]	Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
[10:00.71]	Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
[10:03.86]	There is a mystery--with whom relation
[10:06.69]	Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
[10:09.65]	Which hath an operation more divine
[10:12.36]	Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
[10:15.45]	All the commerce that you have had with Troy
[10:18.73]	As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
[10:21.56]	And better would it fit Achilles much
[10:24.39]	To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
[10:27.03]	But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
[10:30.32]	When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
[10:33.73]	And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
[10:37.14]	'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
[10:40.03]	But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
[10:43.06]	Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
[10:45.96]	The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
[10:49.63]	[Exit]
[10:50.40]PATROCLUS	To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
[10:53.42]	A woman impudent and mannish grown
[10:56.06]	Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
[10:59.22]	In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
[11:02.50]	They think my little stomach to the war
[11:05.46]	And your great love to me restrains you thus:
[11:08.74]	Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
[11:12.15]	Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
[11:15.50]	And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
[11:18.52]	Be shook to air.
[11:19.94]ACHILLES	Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
[11:22.19]PATROCLUS	Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
[11:25.28]ACHILLES	I see my reputation is at stake
[11:27.73]	My fame is shrewdly gored.
[11:29.79]PATROCLUS	O, then, beware;
[11:31.08]	Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
[11:34.68]	Omission to do what is necessary
[11:37.19]	Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
[11:40.15]	And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
[11:42.98]	Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
[11:45.82]ACHILLES	Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
[11:48.84]	I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
[11:51.93]	To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
[11:55.15]	To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
[11:58.62]	An appetite that I am sick withal,
[12:01.20]	To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
[12:04.29]	To talk with him and to behold his visage,
[12:07.38]	Even to my full of view.
[12:09.31]	[Enter THERSITES]
[12:10.08]	A labour saved!
[12:11.43]THERSITES	A wonder!
[12:12.40]ACHILLES	What?
[12:13.11]THERSITES	Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
[12:16.77]ACHILLES	How so?
[12:17.61]THERSITES	He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
[12:21.41]	prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
[12:25.27]	raves in saying nothing.
[12:27.20]ACHILLES	How can that be?
[12:28.62]THERSITES	Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
[12:32.22]	and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
[12:35.89]	arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
[12:39.56]	bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
[12:43.16]	say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'
[12:46.51]	and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
[12:50.31]	in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
[12:53.78]	The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
[12:57.58]	neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
[13:00.74]	vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
[13:04.08]	Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
[13:07.56]	you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
[13:11.23]	grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
[13:14.64]	A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
[13:17.99]	sides, like a leather jerkin.
[13:20.17]ACHILLES	Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
[13:23.39]THERSITES	Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
[13:26.80]	answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
[13:30.21]	tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
[13:33.69]	Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
[13:37.10]	pageant of Ajax.
[13:38.52]ACHILLES	To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
[13:41.86]	valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
[13:45.34]	to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
[13:48.43]	safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
[13:51.84]	and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
[13:55.38]	captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
[13:58.73]	et cetera. Do this.
[14:00.27]PATROCLUS	Jove bless great Ajax!
[14:02.07]THERSITES	Hum!
[14:02.72]PATROCLUS	I come from the worthy Achilles,--
[14:05.16]THERSITES	Ha!
[14:05.74]PATROCLUS	Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--
[14:09.80]THERSITES	Hum!
[14:10.44]PATROCLUS	And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
[14:13.60]THERSITES	Agamemnon!
[14:14.63]PATROCLUS	Ay, my lord.
[14:15.72]THERSITES	Ha!
[14:16.30]PATROCLUS	What say you to't?
[14:17.84]THERSITES	God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
[14:20.23]PATROCLUS	Your answer, sir.
[14:21.64]THERSITES	If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will
[14:25.44]	go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me
[14:29.04]	ere he has me.
[14:30.33]PATROCLUS	Your answer, sir.
[14:31.75]THERSITES	Fare you well, with all my heart.
[14:34.19]ACHILLES	Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
[14:36.96]THERSITES	No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in
[14:40.56]	him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know
[14:44.17]	not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo
[14:47.71]	get his sinews to make catlings on.
[14:50.35]ACHILLES	Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
[14:53.70]THERSITES	Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more
[14:57.49]	capable creature.
[14:58.97]ACHILLES	My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
[15:02.19]	And I myself see not the bottom of it.
[15:05.02]	[Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]
[15:05.80]THERSITES	Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,
[15:09.34]	that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
[15:12.94]	tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
[15:16.29]	[Exit]
