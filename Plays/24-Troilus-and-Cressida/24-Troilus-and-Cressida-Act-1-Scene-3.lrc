[00:00.38]	[The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.,]
[00:01.16]	[Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES,
[00:01.55]	+ MENELAUS, and others]
[00:01.94]AGAMEMNON	Princes,
[00:02.84]	What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
[00:06.34]	The ample proposition that hope makes
[00:09.18]	In all designs begun on earth below
[00:11.90]	Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
[00:15.78]	Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
[00:19.02]	As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
[00:21.93]	Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
[00:25.10]	Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
[00:28.40]	Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
[00:31.05]	That we come short of our suppose so far
[00:34.09]	That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
[00:37.71]	Sith every action that hath gone before,
[00:40.69]	Whereof we have record, trial did draw
[00:43.53]	Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
[00:46.38]	And that unbodied figure of the thought
[00:49.36]	That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
[00:52.85]	Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
[00:56.09]	And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
[00:59.71]	But the protractive trials of great Jove
[01:02.75]	To find persistive constancy in men:
[01:05.47]	The fineness of which metal is not found
[01:08.51]	In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
[01:11.94]	The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
[01:14.91]	The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
[01:18.08]	But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
[01:21.12]	Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
[01:24.23]	Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
[01:27.07]	And what hath mass or matter, by itself
[01:29.99]	Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
[01:32.57]NESTOR	With due observance of thy godlike seat,
[01:35.55]	Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
[01:38.20]	Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
[01:41.31]	Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
[01:44.80]	How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
[01:47.78]	Upon her patient breast, making their way
[01:50.82]	With those of nobler bulk!
[01:52.89]	But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
[01:55.80]	The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
[01:58.39]	The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
[02:02.14]	Bounding between the two moist elements,
[02:05.12]	Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
[02:08.54]	Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
[02:11.59]	Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,
[02:14.88]	Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
[02:17.60]	Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
[02:20.90]	In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
[02:24.59]	The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
[02:27.76]	Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
[02:31.12]	Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
[02:34.16]	And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
[02:38.24]	As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
[02:41.60]	And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
[02:44.64]	Retorts to chiding fortune.
[02:46.78]ULYSSES	Agamemnon,
[02:47.81]	Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
[02:51.18]	Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.
[02:54.28]	In whom the tempers and the minds of all
[02:57.32]	Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
[03:00.49]	Besides the applause and approbation To which,
[03:03.86]	[To AGAMEMNON]
[03:04.64]	most mighty for thy place and sway,
[03:07.29]	[To NESTOR]
[03:08.06]	And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
[03:11.69]	I give to both your speeches, which were such
[03:14.99]	As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
[03:17.70]	Should hold up high in brass, and such again
[03:20.94]	As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
[03:23.78]	Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
[03:27.41]	On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
[03:30.97]	To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
[03:34.52]	Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
[03:37.63]AGAMEMNON	Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
[03:41.06]	That matter needless, of importless burden,
[03:44.16]	Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
[03:47.01]	When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
[03:50.05]	We shall hear music, wit and oracle.
[03:52.70]ULYSSES	Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
[03:55.55]	And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
[03:59.11]	But for these instances.
[04:01.05]	The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
[04:04.15]	And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
[04:07.20]	Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
[04:10.62]	When that the general is not like the hive
[04:13.79]	To whom the foragers shall all repair,
[04:16.64]	What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
[04:19.94]	The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
[04:23.18]	The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
[04:26.86]	Observe degree, priority and place,
[04:29.45]	Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
[04:32.43]	Office and custom, in all line of order;
[04:35.34]	And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
[04:38.38]	In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
[04:41.35]	Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
[04:44.27]	Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
[04:47.31]	And posts, like the commandment of a king,
[04:50.35]	Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
[04:53.91]	In evil mixture to disorder wander,
[04:56.56]	What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
[04:59.73]	What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
[05:02.70]	Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
[05:06.13]	Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
[05:08.91]	The unity and married calm of states
[05:11.70]	Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
[05:15.19]	Which is the ladder to all high designs,
[05:18.17]	Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
[05:21.53]	Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
[05:24.89]	Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
[05:27.87]	The primogenitive and due of birth,
[05:30.52]	Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
[05:33.69]	But by degree, stand in authentic place?
[05:36.60]	Take but degree away, untune that string,
[05:39.58]	And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
[05:43.01]	In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
[05:45.86]	Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
[05:49.35]	And make a sop of all this solid globe:
[05:52.26]	Strength should be lord of imbecility,
[05:55.11]	And the rude son should strike his father dead:
[05:58.54]	Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
[06:02.03]	Between whose endless jar justice resides,
[06:05.13]	Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
[06:08.76]	Then every thing includes itself in power,
[06:11.86]	Power into will, will into appetite;
[06:14.52]	And appetite, an universal wolf,
[06:16.91]	So doubly seconded with will and power,
[06:19.82]	Must make perforce an universal prey,
[06:22.60]	And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
[06:25.58]	This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
[06:28.30]	Follows the choking.
[06:29.98]	And this neglection of degree it is
[06:32.69]	That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
[06:35.93]	It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
[06:38.97]	By him one step below, he by the next,
[06:41.75]	That next by him beneath; so every step,
[06:44.66]	Exampled by the first pace that is sick
[06:47.64]	Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
[06:50.74]	Of pale and bloodless emulation:
[06:53.20]	And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
[06:56.37]	Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
[06:59.54]	Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
[07:03.04]NESTOR	Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
[07:06.08]	The fever whereof all our power is sick.
[07:09.05]AGAMEMNON	The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
[07:12.09]	What is the remedy?
[07:13.71]ULYSSES	The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
[07:16.62]	The sinew and the forehand of our host,
[07:19.53]	Having his ear full of his airy fame,
[07:22.32]	Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
[07:25.42]	Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
[07:28.66]	Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
[07:31.18]	Breaks scurril jests;
[07:32.93]	And with ridiculous and awkward action,
[07:35.84]	Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
[07:38.49]	He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
[07:41.47]	Thy topless deputation he puts on,
[07:44.05]	And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
[07:47.16]	Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
[07:50.46]	To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
[07:53.31]	'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
[07:56.80]	Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
[07:59.97]	He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
[08:03.20]	'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
[08:06.70]	Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
[08:10.19]	Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
[08:13.30]	The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
[08:16.66]	From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
[08:20.09]	Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
[08:22.74]	Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
[08:25.98]	As he being drest to some oration.'
[08:28.56]	That's done, as near as the extremest ends
[08:31.67]	Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
[08:34.90]	Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
[08:37.82]	'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
[08:40.99]	Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
[08:43.57]	And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
[08:46.74]	Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
[08:50.04]	And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
[08:53.02]	Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
[08:56.32]	Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
[08:59.36]	Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
[09:02.53]	In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
[09:05.83]	All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
[09:08.74]	Severals and generals of grace exact,
[09:11.52]	Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
[09:14.37]	Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
[09:17.67]	Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
[09:20.71]	As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
[09:23.75]NESTOR	And in the imitation of these twain--
[09:26.47]	Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
[09:29.12]	With an imperial voice--many are infect.
[09:32.03]	Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
[09:35.33]	In such a rein, in full as proud a place
[09:38.31]	As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
[09:41.41]	Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
[09:44.90]	Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
[09:47.69]	A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
[09:51.05]	To match us in comparisons with dirt,
[09:53.83]	To weaken and discredit our exposure,
[09:56.61]	How rank soever rounded in with danger.
[09:59.53]ULYSSES	They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
[10:02.63]	Count wisdom as no member of the war,
[10:05.41]	Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
[10:08.32]	But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
[10:11.56]	That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
[10:14.86]	When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
[10:18.29]	Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
[10:21.46]	Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
[10:24.24]	They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
[10:27.41]	So that the ram that batters down the wall,
[10:30.58]	For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
[10:33.94]	They place before his hand that made the engine,
[10:37.44]	Or those that with the fineness of their souls
[10:40.87]	By reason guide his execution.
[10:43.19]NESTOR	Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
[10:46.11]	Makes many Thetis' sons.
[10:47.98]	[A tucket]
[10:48.76]AGAMEMNON	What trumpet? look, Menelaus.
[10:50.89]MENELAUS	From Troy.
[10:51.93]	[Enter AENEAS]
[10:52.70]AGAMEMNON	What would you 'fore our tent?
[10:54.97]AENEAS	Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
[10:58.07]AGAMEMNON	Even this.
[10:59.11]AENEAS	May one, that is a herald and a prince,
[11:01.96]	Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
[11:04.74]AGAMEMNON	With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
[11:07.65]	'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
[11:11.21]	Call Agamemnon head and general.
[11:13.67]AENEAS	Fair leave and large security. How may
[11:16.51]	A stranger to those most imperial looks
[11:19.49]	Know them from eyes of other mortals?
[11:22.27]AGAMEMNON	How!
[11:22.92]AENEAS	Ay;
[11:23.50]	I ask, that I might waken reverence,
[11:26.15]	And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
[11:29.13]	Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
[11:32.04]	The youthful Phoebus:
[11:33.79]	Which is that god in office, guiding men?
[11:36.76]	Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
[11:39.67]AGAMEMNON	This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
[11:42.71]	Are ceremonious courtiers.
[11:44.78]AENEAS	Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
[11:47.63]	As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
[11:50.93]	But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
[11:54.55]	Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,
[11:57.53]	Jove's accord,
[11:58.82]	Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
[12:01.93]	Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
[12:04.90]	The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
[12:08.14]	If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
[12:11.83]	But what the repining enemy commends,
[12:14.61]	That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,
[12:17.91]	transcends.
[12:19.01]AGAMEMNON	Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?
[12:22.05]AENEAS	Ay, Greek, that is my name.
[12:24.05]AGAMEMNON	What's your affair I pray you?
[12:26.38]AENEAS	Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
[12:29.10]AGAMEMNON	He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
[12:32.53]AENEAS	Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
[12:35.51]	I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
[12:38.16]	To set his sense on the attentive bent,
[12:41.07]	And then to speak.
[12:42.62]AGAMEMNON	Speak frankly as the wind;
[12:44.69]	It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
[12:47.41]	That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
[12:50.39]	He tells thee so himself.
[12:52.39]AENEAS	Trumpet, blow loud,
[12:53.94]	Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
[12:57.57]	And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
[13:00.48]	What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
[13:03.71]	[Trumpet sounds]
[13:04.49]	We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
[13:07.27]	A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
[13:10.44]	Who in this dull and long-continued truce
[13:13.55]	Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
[13:16.59]	And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
[13:19.95]	If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
[13:23.19]	That holds his honour higher than his ease,
[13:26.36]	That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
[13:30.04]	That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
[13:33.34]	That loves his mistress more than in confession,
[13:36.84]	With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
[13:39.94]	And dare avow her beauty and her worth
[13:42.85]	In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
[13:46.22]	Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
[13:49.19]	Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
[13:52.36]	He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
[13:54.95]	Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
[13:57.93]	And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
[14:00.97]	Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
[14:04.20]	To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
[14:07.18]	If any come, Hector shall honour him;
[14:09.90]	If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
[14:13.00]	The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
[14:16.30]	The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
[14:19.08]AGAMEMNON	This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
[14:22.19]	If none of them have soul in such a kind,
[14:25.23]	We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
[14:28.53]	And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
[14:31.70]	That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
[14:34.80]	If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
[14:37.65]	That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
[14:40.82]NESTOR	Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
[14:43.67]	When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
[14:46.97]	But if there be not in our Grecian host
[14:49.94]	One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
[14:53.05]	To answer for his love, tell him from me
[14:56.02]	I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
[14:59.19]	And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
[15:02.43]	And meeting him will tell him that my lady
[15:05.60]	Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
[15:08.70]	As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
[15:11.81]	I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
[15:15.50]AENEAS	Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
[15:18.60]ULYSSES	Amen.
[15:19.31]AGAMEMNON	Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
[15:22.29]	To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
[15:25.07]	Achilles shall have word of this intent;
[15:28.05]	So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
[15:31.48]	Yourself shall feast with us before you go
[15:34.65]	And find the welcome of a noble foe.
[15:37.36]	[Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR]
[15:38.14]ULYSSES	Nestor!
[15:38.98]NESTOR	What says Ulysses?
[15:40.53]ULYSSES	I have a young conception in my brain;
[15:43.38]	Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
[15:46.42]NESTOR	What is't?
[15:47.46]ULYSSES	This 'tis:
[15:48.43]	Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
[15:51.79]	That hath to this maturity blown up
[15:54.51]	In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
[15:57.48]	Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
[16:00.52]	To overbulk us all.
[16:02.14]NESTOR	Well, and how?
[16:03.37]ULYSSES	This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
[16:06.67]	However it is spread in general name,
[16:09.45]	Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
[16:12.17]NESTOR	The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
[16:15.47]	Whose grossness little characters sum up:
[16:18.51]	And, in the publication, make no strain,
[16:21.36]	But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
[16:24.53]	As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
[16:27.37]	'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,
[16:30.93]	Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
[16:33.84]	Pointing on him.
[16:35.27]ULYSSES	And wake him to the answer, think you?
[16:38.05]NESTOR	Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
[16:41.22]	That can from Hector bring his honour off,
[16:44.32]	If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,
[16:47.69]	Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
[16:50.47]	For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
[16:53.83]	With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
[16:57.39]	Our imputation shall be oddly poised
[17:00.17]	In this wild action; for the success,
[17:02.89]	Although particular, shall give a scantling
[17:06.06]	Of good or bad unto the general;
[17:08.52]	And in such indexes, although small pricks
[17:11.62]	To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
[17:14.73]	The baby figure of the giant mass
[17:17.32]	Of things to come at large. It is supposed
[17:20.42]	He that meets Hector issues from our choice
[17:23.66]	And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
[17:26.96]	Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
[17:29.87]	As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd
[17:32.65]	Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
[17:35.30]	What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
[17:38.99]	To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
[17:41.97]	Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
[17:45.20]	In no less working than are swords and bows
[17:48.44]	Directive by the limbs.
[17:50.31]ULYSSES	Give pardon to my speech:
[17:52.32]	Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
[17:55.55]	Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
[17:58.85]	And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,
[18:01.83]	The lustre of the better yet to show,
[18:04.61]	Shall show the better. Do not consent
[18:07.39]	That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
[18:10.04]	For both our honour and our shame in this
[18:13.15]	Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
[18:16.00]NESTOR	I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
[18:19.36]ULYSSES	What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
[18:22.53]	Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
[18:25.96]	But he already is too insolent;
[18:28.35]	And we were better parch in Afric sun
[18:31.20]	Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
[18:34.50]	Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
[18:37.86]	Why then, we did our main opinion crush
[18:40.77]	In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
[18:43.94]	And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
[18:46.73]	The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
[18:50.09]	Give him allowance for the better man;
[18:52.94]	For that will physic the great Myrmidon
[18:55.91]	Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
[18:59.28]	His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
[19:02.51]	If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
[19:05.55]	We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
[19:08.53]	Yet go we under our opinion still
[19:11.12]	That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
[19:14.09]	Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
[19:17.52]	Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
[19:20.63]NESTOR	Ulysses,
[19:21.53]	Now I begin to relish thy advice;
[19:24.06]	And I will give a taste of it forthwith
[19:27.03]	To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
[19:29.68]	Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
[19:32.85]	Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.
[19:36.28]	[Exeunt]
