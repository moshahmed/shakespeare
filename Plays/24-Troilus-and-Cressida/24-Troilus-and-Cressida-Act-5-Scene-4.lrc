[00:00.47]	[Plains between Troy and the Grecian camp.,]
[00:01.41]	[Alarums: excursions. Enter THERSITES]
[00:02.35]THERSITES	Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go
[00:06.68]	look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,
[00:11.16]	has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's
[00:15.87]	sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see
[00:20.27]	them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that
[00:24.44]	loves the whore there, might send that Greekish
[00:28.61]	whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the
[00:33.09]	dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.
[00:37.49]	O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty
[00:41.58]	swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry
[00:45.82]	cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is
[00:49.99]	not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in
[00:54.31]	policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of
[00:58.63]	as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax
[01:02.80]	prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm
[01:06.96]	to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim
[01:11.21]	barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.
[01:15.37]	Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.
[01:18.60]	[Enter DIOMEDES, TROILUS following]
[01:19.54]TROILUS	Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,
[01:23.63]	I would swim after.
[01:25.59]DIOMEDES	Thou dost miscall retire:
[01:28.03]	I do not fly, but advantageous care
[01:31.25]	Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
[01:34.79]	Have at thee!
[01:36.28]THERSITES	Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,
[01:39.98]	Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!
[01:43.36]	[Exeunt TROILUS and DIOMEDES, fighting]
[01:44.30]	[Enter HECTOR]
[01:45.24]HECTOR	What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?
[01:49.49]	Art thou of blood and honour?
[01:52.24]THERSITES	No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:
[01:56.09]	a very filthy rogue.
[01:58.13]HECTOR	I do believe thee: live.
[02:00.41]	[Exit]
[02:01.36]THERSITES	God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a
[02:05.29]	plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's
[02:09.53]	become of the wenching rogues? I think they have
[02:13.78]	swallowed one another: I would laugh at that
[02:17.71]	miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.
[02:21.48]	I'll seek them.
[02:23.13]	[Exit]
