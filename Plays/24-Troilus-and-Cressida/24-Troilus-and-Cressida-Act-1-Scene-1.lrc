[00:06.00]	[Troy. Before Priam's palace.,]
[00:17.00]	[Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS]
[00:17.73]TROILUS	Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
[00:20.35]	Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
[00:23.34]	That find such cruel battle here within?
[00:26.15]	Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
[00:28.95]	Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.
[00:31.76]PANDARUS	Will this gear ne'er be mended?
[00:34.02]TROILUS	The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
[00:37.55]	Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;
[00:41.21]	But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
[00:43.78]	Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
[00:46.52]	Less valiant than the virgin in the night
[00:49.45]	And skilless as unpractised infancy.
[00:52.01]PANDARUS	Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
[00:55.31]	I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
[00:58.66]	have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
[01:02.63]TROILUS	Have I not tarried?
[01:04.15]PANDARUS	Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry
[01:06.65]	the bolting.
[01:07.75]TROILUS	Have I not tarried?
[01:09.28]PANDARUS	Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.
[01:12.57]TROILUS	Still have I tarried.
[01:14.22]PANDARUS	Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
[01:17.45]	'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the
[01:20.87]	heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
[01:24.16]	stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.
[01:28.00]TROILUS	Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
[01:30.93]	Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
[01:33.92]	At Priam's royal table do I sit;
[01:36.24]	And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--
[01:39.35]	So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?
[01:42.46]PANDARUS	Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
[01:45.94]	her look, or any woman else.
[01:47.95]TROILUS	I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
[01:50.70]	As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
[01:53.63]	Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
[01:56.68]	I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
[01:59.61]	Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
[02:02.35]	But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
[02:05.58]	Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
[02:08.88]PANDARUS	An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
[02:12.29]	well, go to--there were no more comparison between
[02:15.65]	the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I
[02:18.94]	would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
[02:22.30]	somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
[02:25.65]	will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--
[02:29.13]TROILUS	O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
[02:31.45]	When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
[02:34.68]	Reply not in how many fathoms deep
[02:37.18]	They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
[02:40.05]	In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
[02:43.16]	Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
[02:45.85]	Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
[02:49.08]	Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
[02:52.01]	In whose comparison all whites are ink,
[02:54.75]	Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
[02:58.11]	The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
[03:01.34]	Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
[03:04.82]	As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
[03:07.99]	But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
[03:10.80]	Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
[03:14.21]	The knife that made it.
[03:15.98]PANDARUS	I speak no more than truth.
[03:18.00]TROILUS	Thou dost not speak so much.
[03:20.07]PANDARUS	Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:
[03:23.37]	if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
[03:26.66]	not, she has the mends in her own hands.
[03:29.40]TROILUS	Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!
[03:31.66]PANDARUS	I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of
[03:35.32]	her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
[03:38.56]	between, but small thanks for my labour.
[03:41.30]TROILUS	What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?
[03:44.23]PANDARUS	Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair
[03:47.77]	as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
[03:51.24]	fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
[03:54.72]	I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.
[03:58.63]TROILUS	Say I she is not fair?
[04:00.33]PANDARUS	I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
[04:03.81]	stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
[04:07.35]	I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
[04:10.77]	I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
[04:13.69]TROILUS	Pandarus,--
[04:14.61]PANDARUS	Not I.
[04:15.34]TROILUS	Sweet Pandarus,--
[04:16.62]PANDARUS	Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I
[04:20.10]	found it, and there an end.
[04:22.05]	[Exit PANDARUS. An alarum]
[04:22.78]TROILUS	Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
[04:26.08]	Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
[04:29.19]	When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
[04:32.36]	I cannot fight upon this argument;
[04:34.80]	It is too starved a subject for my sword.
[04:37.67]	But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
[04:40.54]	I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
[04:43.28]	And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
[04:45.97]	As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
[04:48.96]	Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
[04:51.58]	What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
[04:54.38]	Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
[04:57.19]	Between our Ilium and where she resides,
[05:00.00]	Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
[05:03.17]	Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
[05:06.28]	Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
[05:09.21]	[Alarum. Enter AENEAS]
[05:09.94]AENEAS	How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?
[05:12.99]TROILUS	Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
[05:16.04]	For womanish it is to be from thence.
[05:18.66]	What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?
[05:21.41]AENEAS	That Paris is returned home and hurt.
[05:24.03]TROILUS	By whom, AEneas?
[05:25.31]AENEAS	Troilus, by Menelaus.
[05:26.90]TROILUS	Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
[05:29.71]	Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
[05:32.15]	[Alarum]
[05:32.88]AENEAS	Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
[05:35.87]TROILUS	Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
[05:38.74]	But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
[05:41.91]AENEAS	In all swift haste.
[05:43.43]TROILUS	Come, go we then together.
[05:45.32]	[Exeunt]
