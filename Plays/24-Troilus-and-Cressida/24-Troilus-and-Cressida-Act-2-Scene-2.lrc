[00:00.43]	[Troy. A room in Priam's palace.,]
[00:01.30]	[Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS]
[00:02.17]PRIAM	After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
[00:05.57]	Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
[00:09.18]	'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
[00:12.08]	As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
[00:15.33]	Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
[00:19.46]	In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
[00:22.71]	Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?
[00:26.40]HECTOR	Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
[00:30.10]	As far as toucheth my particular,
[00:32.92]	Yet, dread Priam,
[00:34.51]	There is no lady of more softer bowels,
[00:37.76]	More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
[00:41.17]	More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
[00:44.86]	Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
[00:48.47]	Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
[00:51.87]	The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
[00:55.64]	To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
[00:58.97]	Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
[01:03.16]	Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
[01:06.85]	Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
[01:10.33]	If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
[01:13.58]	To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
[01:17.05]	Had it our name, the value of one ten,
[01:20.17]	What merit's in that reason which denies
[01:23.57]	The yielding of her up?
[01:25.66]TROILUS	Fie, fie, my brother!
[01:27.47]	Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
[01:30.87]	So great as our dread father in a scale
[01:34.20]	Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
[01:37.82]	The past proportion of his infinite?
[01:40.86]	And buckle in a waist most fathomless
[01:44.04]	With spans and inches so diminutive
[01:47.08]	As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
[01:50.48]HELENUS	No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,
[01:54.25]	You are so empty of them. Should not our father
[01:58.08]	Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
[02:01.99]	Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
[02:05.89]TROILUS	You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
[02:09.73]	You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
[02:13.13]	your reasons:
[02:14.50]	You know an enemy intends you harm;
[02:17.47]	You know a sword employ'd is perilous,
[02:20.66]	And reason flies the object of all harm:
[02:23.98]	Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
[02:27.17]	A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
[02:30.28]	The very wings of reason to his heels
[02:33.46]	And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
[02:36.72]	Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
[02:40.70]	Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
[02:44.75]	Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
[02:48.30]	their thoughts
[02:49.81]	With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
[02:53.43]	Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
[02:56.62]HECTOR	Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
[03:00.23]	The holding.
[03:01.54]TROILUS	What is aught, but as 'tis valued?
[03:04.29]HECTOR	But value dwells not in particular will;
[03:07.61]	It holds his estimate and dignity
[03:10.51]	As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
[03:13.76]	As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
[03:16.66]	To make the service greater than the god
[03:20.06]	And the will dotes that is attributive
[03:23.32]	To what infectiously itself affects,
[03:26.35]	Without some image of the affected merit.
[03:29.76]TROILUS	I take to-day a wife, and my election
[03:32.87]	Is led on in the conduct of my will;
[03:35.91]	My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
[03:39.23]	Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
[03:42.92]	Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
[03:46.04]	Although my will distaste what it elected,
[03:49.51]	The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
[03:52.91]	To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
[03:56.82]	We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
[04:00.51]	When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands
[04:04.56]	We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
[04:07.74]	Because we now are full. It was thought meet
[04:11.36]	Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
[04:15.05]	Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
[04:18.81]	The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
[04:22.58]	And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,
[04:26.55]	And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
[04:30.53]	He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
[04:34.80]	Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
[04:38.57]	Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
[04:42.11]	Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
[04:45.44]	Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
[04:49.42]	And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
[04:52.60]	If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
[04:55.93]	As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--
[04:59.40]	If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
[05:03.17]	As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands
[05:07.15]	And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
[05:10.26]	The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
[05:13.44]	And do a deed that fortune never did,
[05:16.55]	Beggar the estimation which you prized
[05:19.81]	Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
[05:23.35]	That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
[05:26.97]	But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
[05:30.44]	That in their country did them that disgrace,
[05:34.14]	We fear to warrant in our native place!
[05:37.39]CASSANDRA	[Within] Cry, Trojans, cry!
[05:39.42]PRIAM	What noise? what shriek is this?
[05:42.09]TROILUS	'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.
[05:45.35]CASSANDRA	[Within] Cry, Trojans!
[05:47.09]HECTOR	It is Cassandra.
[05:48.68]	[Enter CASSANDRA, raving]
[05:49.55]CASSANDRA	Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,
[05:53.02]	And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
[05:56.49]HECTOR	Peace, sister, peace!
[05:58.30]CASSANDRA	Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
[06:01.78]	Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
[06:05.10]	Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
[06:08.29]	A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
[06:11.47]	Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
[06:15.23]	Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
[06:18.56]	Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
[06:21.96]	Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:
[06:24.86]	Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.
[06:28.19]	[Exit]
[06:29.05]HECTOR	Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
[06:32.89]	Of divination in our sister work
[06:35.71]	Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
[06:39.11]	So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
[06:42.51]	Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
[06:45.77]	Can qualify the same?
[06:47.72]TROILUS	Why, brother Hector,
[06:49.53]	We may not think the justness of each act
[06:53.00]	Such and no other than event doth form it,
[06:56.48]	Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
[06:59.88]	Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
[07:03.78]	Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
[07:07.26]	Which hath our several honours all engaged
[07:10.80]	To make it gracious. For my private part,
[07:14.13]	I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
[07:17.68]	And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
[07:21.58]	Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
[07:25.42]	To fight for and maintain!
[07:27.73]PARIS	Else might the world convince of levity
[07:31.06]	As well my undertakings as your counsels:
[07:34.46]	But I attest the gods, your full consent
[07:37.79]	Gave wings to my propension and cut off
[07:41.12]	All fears attending on so dire a project.
[07:44.52]	For what, alas, can these my single arms?
[07:47.78]	What Propugnation is in one man's valour,
[07:51.18]	To stand the push and enmity of those
[07:54.36]	This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
[07:57.69]	Were I alone to pass the difficulties
[08:00.87]	And had as ample power as I have will,
[08:04.06]	Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
[08:07.75]	Nor faint in the pursuit.
[08:09.99]PRIAM	Paris, you speak
[08:11.58]	Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
[08:14.98]	You have the honey still, but these the gall;
[08:18.60]	So to be valiant is no praise at all.
[08:21.71]PARIS	Sir, I propose not merely to myself
[08:24.68]	The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
[08:28.22]	But I would have the soil of her fair rape
[08:31.77]	Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
[08:34.81]	What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
[08:38.43]	Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
[08:42.19]	Now to deliver her possession up
[08:45.01]	On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
[08:48.19]	That so degenerate a strain as this
[08:51.23]	Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
[08:55.14]	There's not the meanest spirit on our party
[08:58.76]	Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
[09:02.16]	When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
[09:05.56]	Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
[09:09.32]	Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,
[09:12.51]	Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
[09:16.12]	The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
[09:19.52]HECTOR	Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
[09:23.00]	And on the cause and question now in hand
[09:26.47]	Have glozed, but superficially: not much
[09:29.73]	Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
[09:33.05]	Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
[09:35.73]	The reasons you allege do more conduce
[09:38.99]	To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
[09:42.32]	Than to make up a free determination
[09:45.43]	'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
[09:49.26]	Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
[09:52.95]	Of any true decision. Nature craves
[09:55.92]	All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
[09:59.32]	What nearer debt in all humanity
[10:02.14]	Than wife is to the husband? If this law
[10:05.47]	Of nature be corrupted through affection,
[10:08.87]	And that great minds, of partial indulgence
[10:12.42]	To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
[10:15.74]	There is a law in each well-order'd nation
[10:19.29]	To curb those raging appetites that are
[10:22.62]	Most disobedient and refractory.
[10:25.37]	If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
[10:28.62]	As it is known she is, these moral laws
[10:31.88]	Of nature and of nations speak aloud
[10:34.99]	To have her back return'd: thus to persist
[10:38.46]	In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
[10:41.50]	But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
[10:45.27]	Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
[10:48.67]	My spritely brethren, I propend to you
[10:51.85]	In resolution to keep Helen still,
[10:54.74]	For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
[10:58.43]	Upon our joint and several dignities.
[11:01.55]TROILUS	Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:
[11:05.24]	Were it not glory that we more affected
[11:08.56]	Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
[11:12.18]	I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
[11:15.51]	Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
[11:19.13]	She is a theme of honour and renown,
[11:22.17]	A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
[11:25.50]	Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
[11:29.19]	And fame in time to come canonize us;
[11:32.30]	For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
[11:35.77]	So rich advantage of a promised glory
[11:38.95]	As smiles upon the forehead of this action
[11:42.50]	For the wide world's revenue.
[11:45.03]HECTOR	I am yours,
[11:46.26]	You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
[11:49.52]	I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
[11:52.92]	The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
[11:56.39]	Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
[12:00.15]	I was advertised their great general slept,
[12:03.70]	Whilst emulation in the army crept:
[12:06.67]	This, I presume, will wake him.
[12:09.20]	[Exeunt]
