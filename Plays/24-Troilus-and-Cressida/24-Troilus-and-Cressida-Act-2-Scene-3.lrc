[00:00.39]	[The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.,]
[00:01.18]	[Enter THERSITES, solus]
[00:01.97]THERSITES	How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of
[00:05.52]	thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
[00:09.20]	beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!
[00:12.81]	would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,
[00:16.23]	whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
[00:19.45]	conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of
[00:23.26]	my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a
[00:26.81]	rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
[00:30.42]	undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of
[00:34.23]	themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
[00:37.91]	forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,
[00:41.40]	Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
[00:44.75]	caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less
[00:48.30]	than little wit from them that they have! which
[00:51.78]	short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
[00:55.46]	scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
[00:59.14]	from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and
[01:02.95]	cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the
[01:06.50]	whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,
[01:09.79]	methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war
[01:13.47]	for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
[01:17.28]	say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
[01:19.91]	[Enter PATROCLUS]
[01:20.70]PATROCLUS	Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.
[01:24.64]THERSITES	If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou
[01:28.39]	wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
[01:32.26]	it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common
[01:35.81]	curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in
[01:39.43]	great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and
[01:43.04]	discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
[01:46.79]	direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
[01:50.60]	out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and
[01:54.21]	sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
[01:57.70]	Amen. Where's Achilles?
[01:59.54]PATROCLUS	What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?
[02:02.63]THERSITES	Ay: the heavens hear me!
[02:04.53]	[Enter ACHILLES]
[02:05.32]ACHILLES	Who's there?
[02:06.50]PATROCLUS	Thersites, my lord.
[02:08.08]ACHILLES	Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my
[02:11.30]	digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to
[02:14.91]	my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
[02:18.27]THERSITES	Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,
[02:21.68]	what's Achilles?
[02:23.13]PATROCLUS	Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,
[02:26.42]	what's thyself?
[02:27.80]THERSITES	Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,
[02:31.08]	what art thou?
[02:32.40]PATROCLUS	Thou mayst tell that knowest.
[02:34.70]ACHILLES	O, tell, tell.
[02:35.88]THERSITES	I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
[02:39.62]	Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'
[02:42.91]	knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
[02:45.34]PATROCLUS	You rascal!
[02:46.46]THERSITES	Peace, fool! I have not done.
[02:48.63]ACHILLES	He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.
[02:51.72]THERSITES	Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites
[02:55.33]	is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
[02:58.81]ACHILLES	Derive this; come.
[03:00.33]THERSITES	Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;
[03:03.94]	Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;
[03:07.49]	Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and
[03:10.84]	Patroclus is a fool positive.
[03:13.14]PATROCLUS	Why am I a fool?
[03:14.59]THERSITES	Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
[03:18.33]	art. Look you, who comes here?
[03:20.57]ACHILLES	Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.
[03:23.13]	Come in with me, Thersites.
[03:25.23]	[Exit]
[03:26.02]THERSITES	Here is such patchery, such juggling and such
[03:29.37]	knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a
[03:32.66]	whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
[03:36.08]	and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on
[03:39.56]	the subject! and war and lechery confound all!
[03:42.91]	[Exit]
[03:43.70]	[Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAX]
[03:44.49]AGAMEMNON	Where is Achilles?
[03:46.07]PATROCLUS	Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.
[03:49.15]AGAMEMNON	Let it be known to him that we are here.
[03:52.18]	He shent our messengers; and we lay by
[03:55.07]	Our appertainments, visiting of him:
[03:57.76]	Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
[04:00.98]	We dare not move the question of our place,
[04:04.20]	Or know not what we are.
[04:06.18]PATROCLUS	I shall say so to him.
[04:08.02]	[Exit]
[04:08.80]ULYSSES	We saw him at the opening of his tent:
[04:11.70]	He is not sick.
[04:13.08]AJAX	Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it
[04:16.76]	melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my
[04:20.30]	head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the
[04:23.79]	cause. A word, my lord.
[04:25.56]	[Takes AGAMEMNON aside]
[04:26.35]NESTOR	What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
[04:29.05]ULYSSES	Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
[04:32.20]NESTOR	Who, Thersites?
[04:33.51]ULYSSES	He.
[04:34.11]NESTOR	Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.
[04:38.18]ULYSSES	No, you see, he is his argument that has his
[04:41.40]	argument, Achilles.
[04:42.98]NESTOR	All the better; their fraction is more our wish than
[04:46.79]	their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
[04:50.53]	could disunite.
[04:51.92]ULYSSES	The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily
[04:55.53]	untie. Here comes Patroclus.
[04:57.70]	[Re-enter PATROCLUS]
[04:58.49]NESTOR	No Achilles with him.
[05:00.26]ULYSSES	The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:
[05:03.74]	his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
[05:07.29]PATROCLUS	Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,
[05:10.18]	If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
[05:13.67]	Did move your greatness and this noble state
[05:17.02]	To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
[05:20.11]	But for your health and your digestion sake,
[05:23.39]	And after-dinner's breath.
[05:25.50]AGAMEMNON	Hear you, Patroclus:
[05:27.14]	We are too well acquainted with these answers:
[05:30.56]	But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
[05:33.91]	Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
[05:36.41]	Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
[05:39.63]	Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
[05:42.98]	Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
[05:45.87]	Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
[05:48.96]	Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
[05:52.18]	Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
[05:55.27]	We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
[05:58.82]	If you do say we think him over-proud
[06:01.71]	And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
[06:04.99]	Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
[06:08.15]	than himself
[06:09.40]	Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
[06:12.68]	Disguise the holy strength of their command,
[06:15.97]	And underwrite in an observing kind
[06:18.73]	His humorous predominance; yea, watch
[06:21.49]	His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
[06:24.71]	The passage and whole carriage of this action
[06:28.13]	Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
[06:31.28]	That if he overhold his price so much,
[06:34.17]	We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
[06:37.52]	Not portable, lie under this report:
[06:40.22]	'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
[06:43.37]	A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
[06:46.26]	Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
[06:49.02]PATROCLUS	I shall; and bring his answer presently.
[06:51.98]	[Exit]
[06:52.77]AGAMEMNON	In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
[06:55.73]	We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
[06:59.01]	[Exit ULYSSES]
[06:59.80]AJAX	What is he more than another?
[07:02.10]AGAMEMNON	No more than what he thinks he is.
[07:04.73]AJAX	Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
[07:08.48]	better man than I am?
[07:10.25]AGAMEMNON	No question.
[07:11.43]AJAX	Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
[07:14.79]AGAMEMNON	No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as
[07:18.20]	wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether
[07:21.95]	more tractable.
[07:23.33]AJAX	Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
[07:26.88]	know not what pride is.
[07:28.78]AGAMEMNON	Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
[07:32.53]	fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
[07:36.14]	his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;
[07:39.69]	and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours
[07:43.51]	the deed in the praise.
[07:45.41]AJAX	I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.
[07:49.55]NESTOR	Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
[07:52.44]	[Aside]
[07:53.23]	[Re-enter ULYSSES]
[07:54.02]ULYSSES	Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
[07:57.11]AGAMEMNON	What's his excuse?
[07:58.69]ULYSSES	He doth rely on none,
[08:00.46]	But carries on the stream of his dispose
[08:03.55]	Without observance or respect of any,
[08:06.38]	In will peculiar and in self-admission.
[08:09.33]AGAMEMNON	Why will he not upon our fair request
[08:12.22]	Untent his person and share the air with us?
[08:15.51]ULYSSES	Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
[08:19.06]	He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,
[08:22.74]	And speaks not to himself but with a pride
[08:25.96]	That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
[08:29.25]	Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
[08:32.79]	That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
[08:36.01]	Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
[08:38.91]	And batters down himself: what should I say?
[08:42.13]	He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
[08:45.81]	Cry 'No recovery.'
[08:47.25]AGAMEMNON	Let Ajax go to him.
[08:48.89]	Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
[08:52.11]	'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
[08:55.34]	At your request a little from himself.
[08:58.23]ULYSSES	O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
[09:00.53]	We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
[09:03.75]	When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
[09:07.30]	That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
[09:10.58]	And never suffers matter of the world
[09:13.47]	Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
[09:16.69]	And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd
[09:19.98]	Of that we hold an idol more than he?
[09:22.81]	No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
[09:26.16]	Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;
[09:29.31]	Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
[09:32.14]	As amply titled as Achilles is,
[09:34.57]	By going to Achilles:
[09:36.34]	That were to enlard his fat already pride
[09:39.50]	And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
[09:42.72]	With entertaining great Hyperion.
[09:45.28]	This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
[09:47.98]	And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
[09:50.87]NESTOR	[Aside to DIOMEDES] O, this is well; he rubs the
[09:53.43]	vein of him.
[09:54.61]DIOMEDES	[Aside to NESTOR] And how his silence drinks up
[09:57.37]	this applause!
[09:58.69]AJAX	If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.
[10:03.16]AGAMEMNON	O, no, you shall not go.
[10:05.00]AJAX	An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:
[10:08.28]	Let me go to him.
[10:09.79]ULYSSES	Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
[10:13.21]AJAX	A paltry, insolent fellow!
[10:15.25]NESTOR	How he describes himself!
[10:17.29]AJAX	Can he not be sociable?
[10:19.19]ULYSSES	The raven chides blackness.
[10:21.36]AJAX	I'll let his humours blood.
[10:23.53]AGAMEMNON	He will be the physician that should be the patient.
[10:27.34]AJAX	An all men were o' my mind,--
[10:29.44]ULYSSES	Wit would be out of fashion.
[10:31.68]AJAX	A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:
[10:35.36]	shall pride carry it?
[10:37.13]NESTOR	An 'twould, you'ld carry half.
[10:39.37]ULYSSES	A' would have ten shares.
[10:41.34]AJAX	I will knead him; I'll make him supple.
[10:44.23]NESTOR	He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
[10:47.84]	pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
[10:50.60]ULYSSES	[To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
[10:54.15]NESTOR	Our noble general, do not do so.
[10:56.59]DIOMEDES	You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
[10:59.81]ULYSSES	Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
[11:02.89]	Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
[11:05.79]	I will be silent.
[11:07.30]NESTOR	Wherefore should you so?
[11:09.27]	He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
[11:11.83]ULYSSES	Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
[11:14.72]AJAX	A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!
[11:18.14]	Would he were a Trojan!
[11:20.05]NESTOR	What a vice were it in Ajax now,--
[11:22.54]ULYSSES	If he were proud,--
[11:24.06]DIOMEDES	Or covetous of praise,--
[11:25.90]ULYSSES	Ay, or surly borne,--
[11:27.47]DIOMEDES	Or strange, or self-affected!
[11:29.71]ULYSSES	Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;
[11:33.45]	Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
[11:37.07]	Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
[11:40.29]	Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:
[11:42.92]	But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,
[11:46.07]	Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
[11:48.70]	And give him half: and, for thy vigour,
[11:51.53]	Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
[11:54.35]	To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
[11:57.64]	Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
[12:00.86]	Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;
[12:04.21]	Instructed by the antiquary times,
[12:06.84]	He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:
[12:09.60]	Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
[12:12.62]	As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,
[12:15.91]	You should not have the eminence of him,
[12:18.93]	But be as Ajax.
[12:20.31]AJAX	Shall I call you father?
[12:22.28]NESTOR	Ay, my good son.
[12:23.66]DIOMEDES	Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.
[12:25.76]ULYSSES	There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
[12:29.05]	Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
[12:32.21]	To call together all his state of war;
[12:35.10]	Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
[12:38.05]	We must with all our main of power stand fast:
[12:41.47]	And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
[12:45.09]	And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
[12:48.57]AGAMEMNON	Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
[12:51.33]	Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
[12:55.27]	[Exeunt]
