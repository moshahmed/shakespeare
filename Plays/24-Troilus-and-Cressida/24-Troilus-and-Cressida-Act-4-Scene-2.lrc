[00:00.45]	[The same. Court of Pandarus' house.,]
[00:01.35]	[Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA]
[00:02.25]TROILUS	Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
[00:05.94]CRESSIDA	Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
[00:09.78]	He shall unbolt the gates.
[00:12.19]TROILUS	Trouble him not;
[00:13.85]	To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
[00:17.54]	And give as soft attachment to thy senses
[00:21.16]	As infants' empty of all thought!
[00:24.02]CRESSIDA	Good morrow, then.
[00:25.75]TROILUS	I prithee now, to bed.
[00:27.78]CRESSIDA	Are you a-weary of me?
[00:29.89]TROILUS	O Cressida! but that the busy day,
[00:32.83]	Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
[00:36.82]	And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
[00:40.89]	I would not from thee.
[00:42.99]CRESSIDA	Night hath been too brief.
[00:45.40]TROILUS	Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
[00:49.55]	As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
[00:53.76]	With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
[00:57.60]	You will catch cold, and curse me.
[01:00.54]CRESSIDA	Prithee, tarry:
[01:02.05]	You men will never tarry.
[01:04.38]	O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
[01:08.30]	And then you would have tarried. Hark!
[01:11.54]	there's one up.
[01:13.12]PANDARUS	[Within] What, 's all the doors open here?
[01:16.35]TROILUS	It is your uncle.
[01:18.09]CRESSIDA	A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
[01:21.78]	I shall have such a life!
[01:24.11]	[Enter PANDARUS]
[01:25.01]PANDARUS	How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you
[01:28.78]	maid! where's my cousin Cressid?
[01:31.57]CRESSIDA	Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
[01:35.26]	You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
[01:39.10]PANDARUS	To do what? to do what? let her say
[01:42.11]	what: what have I brought you to do?
[01:45.20]CRESSIDA	Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
[01:49.41]	Nor suffer others.
[01:51.22]PANDARUS	Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!
[01:54.76]	hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty
[01:58.75]	man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!
[02:01.91]CRESSIDA	Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
[02:06.28]	[Knocking within]
[02:07.19]	Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
[02:10.73]	My lord, come you again into my chamber:
[02:14.11]	You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
[02:18.03]TROILUS	Ha, ha!
[02:18.93]CRESSIDA	Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
[02:22.92]	[Knocking within]
[02:23.83]	How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
[02:27.44]	I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
[02:31.28]	[Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA]
[02:32.19]PANDARUS	Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
[02:35.95]	down the door? How now! what's the matter?
[02:39.42]	[Enter AENEAS]
[02:40.32]AENEAS	Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
[02:42.96]PANDARUS	Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
[02:46.34]	I knew you not: what news with you so early?
[02:50.03]AENEAS	Is not Prince Troilus here?
[02:52.52]PANDARUS	Here! what should he do here?
[02:55.08]AENEAS	Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
[02:58.54]	It doth import him much to speak with me.
[03:02.08]PANDARUS	Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll
[03:05.92]	be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What
[03:09.76]	should he do here?
[03:11.57]AENEAS	Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
[03:15.26]	ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
[03:19.25]	false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
[03:23.24]	fetch him hither; go.
[03:25.20]	[Re-enter TROILUS]
[03:26.11]TROILUS	How now! what's the matter?
[03:28.52]AENEAS	My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
[03:32.28]	My matter is so rash: there is at hand
[03:35.59]	Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
[03:38.53]	The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
[03:41.62]	Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
[03:44.93]	Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
[03:48.47]	We must give up to Diomedes' hand
[03:51.41]	The Lady Cressida.
[03:53.22]TROILUS	Is it so concluded?
[03:55.10]AENEAS	By Priam and the general state of Troy:
[03:58.49]	They are at hand and ready to effect it.
[04:01.95]TROILUS	How my achievements mock me!
[04:04.51]	I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,
[04:07.90]	We met by chance; you did not find me here.
[04:11.52]AENEAS	Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
[04:14.98]	Have not more gift in taciturnity.
[04:17.99]	[Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS]
[04:18.90]PANDARUS	Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
[04:22.89]	take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
[04:26.65]	plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!
[04:30.87]	[Re-enter CRESSIDA]
[04:31.77]CRESSIDA	How now! what's the matter? who was here?
[04:35.16]PANDARUS	Ah, ah!
[04:36.06]CRESSIDA	Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
[04:40.13]	Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
[04:43.44]PANDARUS	Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
[04:47.74]CRESSIDA	O the gods! what's the matter?
[04:50.37]PANDARUS	Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
[04:54.44]	born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor
[04:58.28]	gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
[05:01.14]CRESSIDA	Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,
[05:05.28]	what's the matter?
[05:07.09]PANDARUS	Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou
[05:11.08]	art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,
[05:15.15]	and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;
[05:18.91]	'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.
[05:22.08]CRESSIDA	O you immortal gods! I will not go.
[05:25.09]PANDARUS	Thou must.
[05:26.29]CRESSIDA	I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;
[05:29.83]	I know no touch of consanguinity;
[05:32.77]	No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me
[05:36.46]	As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
[05:39.85]	Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
[05:43.91]	If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
[05:47.91]	Do to this body what extremes you can;
[05:51.22]	But the strong base and building of my love
[05:54.98]	Is as the very centre of the earth,
[05:58.07]	Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--
[06:01.91]PANDARUS	Do, do.
[06:02.82]CRESSIDA	Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,
[06:07.03]	Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
[06:11.25]	With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
[06:15.17]	[Exeunt]
