[00:02.70]PARIS	It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
[00:07.03]	Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
[00:10.99]	Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
[00:15.14]	Tell you the lady what she is to do,
[00:18.92]	And haste her to the purpose.
[00:22.08]TROILUS	Walk into her house;
[00:24.42]	I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
[00:28.57]	And to his hand when I deliver her,
[00:32.26]	Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
[00:36.59]	A priest there offering to it his own heart.

[00:44.88]	And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
[00:48.94]	Please you walk in, my lords.
