[00:00.41]	[The Same. A street.,]
[00:01.23]	[Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER]
[00:02.05]CRESSIDA	Who were those went by?
[00:04.04]ALEXANDER	Queen Hecuba and Helen.
[00:06.02]CRESSIDA	And whither go they?
[00:07.80]ALEXANDER	Up to the eastern tower,
[00:09.86]	Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
[00:13.42]	To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
[00:16.57]	Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
[00:19.58]	He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
[00:22.94]	And, like as there were husbandry in war,
[00:26.09]	Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
[00:29.44]	And to the field goes he; where every flower
[00:32.87]	Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
[00:35.88]	In Hector's wrath.
[00:37.52]CRESSIDA	What was his cause of anger?
[00:39.85]ALEXANDER	The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
[00:43.41]	A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
[00:46.56]	They call him Ajax.
[00:48.28]CRESSIDA	Good; and what of him?
[00:50.13]ALEXANDER	They say he is a very man per se,
[00:52.80]	And stands alone.
[00:54.37]CRESSIDA	So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
[00:58.69]ALEXANDER	This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
[01:02.32]	particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
[01:06.15]	churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
[01:09.85]	into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
[01:13.68]	valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
[01:17.59]	discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
[01:21.35]	hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
[01:25.33]	carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
[01:29.16]	cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
[01:32.65]	joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
[01:36.69]	that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
[01:40.53]	or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
[01:43.68]CRESSIDA	But how should this man, that makes
[01:46.49]	me smile, make Hector angry?
[01:48.75]ALEXANDER	They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
[01:52.79]	struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
[01:56.69]	ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
[01:59.98]CRESSIDA	Who comes here?
[02:01.42]ALEXANDER	Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
[02:03.61]	[Enter PANDARUS]
[02:04.43]CRESSIDA	Hector's a gallant man.
[02:06.42]ALEXANDER	As may be in the world, lady.
[02:08.75]PANDARUS	What's that? what's that?
[02:10.80]CRESSIDA	Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
[02:13.06]PANDARUS	Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
[02:16.69]	Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
[02:20.18]	were you at Ilium?
[02:21.83]CRESSIDA	This morning, uncle.
[02:23.54]PANDARUS	What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
[02:27.24]	armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
[02:31.07]	up, was she?
[02:32.24]CRESSIDA	Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
[02:35.18]PANDARUS	Even so: Hector was stirring early.
[02:37.92]CRESSIDA	That were we talking of, and of his anger.
[02:41.14]PANDARUS	Was he angry?
[02:42.44]CRESSIDA	So he says here.
[02:43.95]PANDARUS	True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay
[02:47.51]	about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's
[02:51.34]	Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
[02:55.25]	heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
[02:58.47]CRESSIDA	What, is he angry too?
[03:00.31]PANDARUS	Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
[03:04.08]CRESSIDA	O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
[03:06.68]PANDARUS	What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a
[03:10.52]	man if you see him?
[03:12.23]CRESSIDA	Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
[03:15.45]PANDARUS	Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
[03:17.91]CRESSIDA	Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.
[03:21.96]PANDARUS	No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
[03:25.45]CRESSIDA	'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
[03:28.53]PANDARUS	Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.
[03:31.82]CRESSIDA	So he is.
[03:32.84]PANDARUS	Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.
[03:35.93]CRESSIDA	He is not Hector.
[03:37.50]PANDARUS	Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
[03:40.72]	himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend
[03:44.49]	or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
[03:48.12]	in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
[03:52.29]CRESSIDA	Excuse me.
[03:53.39]PANDARUS	He is elder.
[03:54.62]CRESSIDA	Pardon me, pardon me.
[03:56.40]PANDARUS	Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another
[04:00.31]	tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not
[04:04.00]	have his wit this year.
[04:05.99]CRESSIDA	He shall not need it, if he have his own.
[04:09.14]PANDARUS	Nor his qualities.
[04:10.78]CRESSIDA	No matter.
[04:11.88]PANDARUS	Nor his beauty.
[04:13.32]CRESSIDA	'Twould not become him; his own's better.
[04:16.40]PANDARUS	You have no judgment, niece: Helen
[04:19.07]	herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for
[04:22.50]	a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--
[04:25.71]	not brown neither,--
[04:27.36]CRESSIDA	No, but brown.
[04:28.66]PANDARUS	'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
[04:31.74]CRESSIDA	To say the truth, true and not true.
[04:34.55]PANDARUS	She praised his complexion above Paris.
[04:37.63]CRESSIDA	Why, Paris hath colour enough.
[04:40.03]PANDARUS	So he has.
[04:41.12]CRESSIDA	Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
[04:44.89]	him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
[04:48.52]	having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
[04:52.29]	flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
[04:55.98]	lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
[05:00.02]	a copper nose.
[05:01.39]PANDARUS	I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
[05:05.71]CRESSIDA	Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
[05:08.31]PANDARUS	Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other
[05:12.01]	day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
[05:15.57]	has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--
[05:19.06]CRESSIDA	Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
[05:22.83]	particulars therein to a total.
[05:25.36]PANDARUS	Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within
[05:28.79]	three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.
[05:32.42]CRESSIDA	Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
[05:35.64]PANDARUS	But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
[05:39.47]	and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
[05:43.03]CRESSIDA	Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
[05:45.84]PANDARUS	Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
[05:49.33]	becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
[05:52.96]CRESSIDA	O, he smiles valiantly.
[05:54.88]PANDARUS	Does he not?
[05:56.11]CRESSIDA	O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
[05:58.78]PANDARUS	Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
[06:02.35]	loves Troilus,--
[06:03.72]CRESSIDA	Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
[06:07.00]	prove it so.
[06:08.24]PANDARUS	Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
[06:12.00]	an addle egg.
[06:13.30]CRESSIDA	If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
[06:17.34]	head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.
[06:20.49]PANDARUS	I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
[06:24.40]	his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
[06:28.23]	must needs confess,--
[06:29.94]CRESSIDA	Without the rack.
[06:31.52]PANDARUS	And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
[06:35.70]CRESSIDA	Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
[06:38.64]PANDARUS	But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
[06:42.41]	that her eyes ran o'er.
[06:44.40]CRESSIDA	With mill-stones.
[06:45.97]PANDARUS	And Cassandra laughed.
[06:47.89]CRESSIDA	But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
[06:51.79]	her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
[06:54.60]PANDARUS	And Hector laughed.
[06:56.31]CRESSIDA	At what was all this laughing?
[06:58.78]PANDARUS	Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
[07:03.09]CRESSIDA	An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
[07:06.86]	too.
[07:07.54]PANDARUS	They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
[07:12.13]CRESSIDA	What was his answer?
[07:13.91]PANDARUS	Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your
[07:17.68]	chin, and one of them is white.
[07:20.14]CRESSIDA	This is her question.
[07:21.99]PANDARUS	That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and
[07:25.49]	fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white
[07:29.05]	hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'
[07:32.75]	'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,
[07:36.44]	my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't
[07:39.80]	out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!
[07:43.50]	and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
[07:47.47]	rest so laughed, that it passed.
[07:50.00]CRESSIDA	So let it now; for it has been while going by.
[07:53.50]PANDARUS	Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
[07:57.47]CRESSIDA	So I do.
[07:58.43]PANDARUS	I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere
[08:02.19]	a man born in April.
[08:03.97]CRESSIDA	And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
[08:07.81]	against May.
[08:09.04]	[A retreat sounded]
[08:09.86]PANDARUS	Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
[08:13.36]	stand up here, and see them as they pass toward
[08:16.99]	Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
[08:20.20]CRESSIDA	At your pleasure.
[08:21.78]PANDARUS	Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may
[08:25.48]	see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
[08:29.24]	names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
[08:33.35]CRESSIDA	Speak not so loud.
[08:35.00]	[AENEAS passes]
[08:35.82]PANDARUS	That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
[08:39.65]	the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark
[08:43.08]	Troilus; you shall see anon.
[08:45.34]	[ANTENOR passes]
[08:46.16]CRESSIDA	Who's that?
[08:47.32]PANDARUS	That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;
[08:51.16]	and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest
[08:55.06]	judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
[08:58.90]	When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
[09:02.67]	he see me, you shall see him nod at me.
[09:05.68]CRESSIDA	Will he give you the nod?
[09:07.80]PANDARUS	You shall see.
[09:09.17]CRESSIDA	If he do, the rich shall have more.
[09:11.91]	[HECTOR passes]
[09:12.73]PANDARUS	That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
[09:16.43]	fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,
[09:19.92]	niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
[09:23.55]	a countenance! is't not a brave man?
[09:26.36]CRESSIDA	O, a brave man!
[09:27.73]PANDARUS	Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
[09:31.22]	what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do
[09:34.92]	you see? look you there: there's no jesting;
[09:38.21]	there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:
[09:42.04]	there be hacks!
[09:43.48]CRESSIDA	Be those with swords?
[09:45.33]PANDARUS	Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come
[09:49.03]	to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's
[09:52.66]	heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
[09:56.43]	[PARIS passes]
[09:57.25]	Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,
[10:00.95]	is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came
[10:04.64]	hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do
[10:08.34]	Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see
[10:11.77]	Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
[10:14.85]	[HELENUS passes]
[10:15.67]CRESSIDA	Who's that?
[10:16.83]PANDARUS	That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
[10:20.53]	Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
[10:24.78]CRESSIDA	Can Helenus fight, uncle?
[10:26.83]PANDARUS	Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I
[10:30.39]	marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
[10:34.16]	people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
[10:37.24]CRESSIDA	What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
[10:39.98]	[TROILUS passes]
[10:40.80]PANDARUS	Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
[10:44.09]	there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
[10:47.38]	prince of chivalry!
[10:49.09]CRESSIDA	Peace, for shame, peace!
[10:51.01]PANDARUS	Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
[10:54.77]	him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
[10:58.54]	his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,
[11:02.51]	and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
[11:06.14]	three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
[11:09.77]	Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
[11:13.74]	he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
[11:17.44]	Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to
[11:20.87]	change, would give an eye to boot.
[11:23.54]CRESSIDA	Here come more.
[11:24.98]	[Forces pass]
[11:25.80]PANDARUS	Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
[11:29.50]	porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
[11:33.13]	eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles
[11:36.89]	are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
[11:40.38]	rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
[11:44.29]	all Greece.
[11:45.45]CRESSIDA	There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.
[11:50.04]PANDARUS	Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.
[11:53.26]CRESSIDA	Well, well.
[11:54.36]PANDARUS	'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have
[11:57.71]	you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
[12:01.27]	birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
[12:04.56]	learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
[12:07.98]	and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
[12:11.89]CRESSIDA	Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
[12:15.72]	in the pie, for then the man's date's out.
[12:18.94]PANDARUS	You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
[12:22.91]	lie.
[12:23.60]CRESSIDA	Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to
[12:27.23]	defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
[12:30.86]	honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
[12:34.49]	defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
[12:38.39]	thousand watches.
[12:39.97]PANDARUS	Say one of your watches.
[12:42.02]CRESSIDA	Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
[12:45.86]	chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
[12:49.76]	not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
[12:53.73]	the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
[12:57.63]	past watching.
[12:59.00]PANDARUS	You are such another!
[13:00.85]	[Enter Troilus's Boy]
[13:01.68]Boy	Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
[13:05.03]PANDARUS	Where?
[13:05.85]Boy	At your own house; there he unarms him.
[13:08.87]PANDARUS	Good boy, tell him I come.
[13:10.99]	[Exit boy]
[13:11.81]	I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
[13:15.17]CRESSIDA	Adieu, uncle.
[13:16.40]PANDARUS	I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
[13:19.07]CRESSIDA	To bring, uncle?
[13:20.51]PANDARUS	Ay, a token from Troilus.
[13:22.56]CRESSIDA	By the same token, you are a bawd.
[13:25.23]	[Exit PANDARUS]
[13:26.06]	Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
[13:29.82]	He offers in another's enterprise;
[13:32.56]	But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
[13:35.71]	Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
[13:39.14]	Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
[13:42.22]	Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
[13:45.98]	That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
[13:49.82]	Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
[13:53.31]	That she was never yet that ever knew
[13:56.33]	Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
[13:59.54]	Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
[14:02.76]	Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
[14:05.91]	Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
[14:09.82]	Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
[14:13.24]	[Exeunt]
