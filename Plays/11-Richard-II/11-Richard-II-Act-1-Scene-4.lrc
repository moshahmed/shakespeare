[00:00.37]	[The court.,]
[00:01.11]	[Enter KING RICHARD II, with BAGOT and GREEN at one
[00:01.48]	+ door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another]
[00:01.85]KING RICHARD II	We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
[00:04.07]	How far brought you high Hereford on his way?
[00:07.21]DUKE OF AUMERLE	I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
[00:10.23]	But to the next highway, and there I left him.
[00:13.38]KING RICHARD II	And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
[00:16.59]DUKE OF AUMERLE	Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
[00:19.73]	Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
[00:22.75]	Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
[00:25.78]	Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
[00:28.67]KING RICHARD II	What said our cousin when you parted with him?
[00:31.88]DUKE OF AUMERLE	'Farewell:'
[00:32.81]	And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
[00:35.77]	Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
[00:39.10]	To counterfeit oppression of such grief
[00:41.93]	That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
[00:45.14]	Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
[00:48.72]	And added years to his short banishment,
[00:51.56]	He should have had a volume of farewells;
[00:54.45]	But since it would not, he had none of me.
[00:57.35]KING RICHARD II	He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
[01:00.07]	When time shall call him home from banishment,
[01:03.27]	Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
[01:06.36]	Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
[01:09.13]	Observed his courtship to the common people;
[01:12.22]	How he did seem to dive into their hearts
[01:15.18]	With humble and familiar courtesy,
[01:17.64]	What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
[01:20.67]	Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
[01:23.94]	And patient underbearing of his fortune,
[01:26.77]	As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
[01:29.73]	Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
[01:32.51]	A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
[01:35.47]	And had the tribute of his supple knee,
[01:38.24]	With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
[01:41.33]	As were our England in reversion his,
[01:43.98]	And he our subjects' next degree in hope.
[01:46.82]GREEN	Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
[01:50.09]	Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
[01:53.29]	Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
[01:56.07]	Ere further leisure yield them further means
[01:59.21]	For their advantage and your highness' loss.
[02:02.24]KING RICHARD II	We will ourself in person to this war:
[02:04.95]	And, for our coffers, with too great a court
[02:07.97]	And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
[02:11.12]	We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
[02:13.95]	The revenue whereof shall furnish us
[02:16.61]	For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
[02:19.63]	Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
[02:23.08]	Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
[02:26.35]	They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
[02:29.74]	And send them after to supply our wants;
[02:32.58]	For we will make for Ireland presently.
[02:35.36]	[Enter BUSHY]
[02:36.10]	Bushy, what news?
[02:37.45]BUSHY	Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
[02:40.47]	Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
[02:43.31]	To entreat your majesty to visit him.
[02:45.96]KING RICHARD II	Where lies he?
[02:47.20]BUSHY	At Ely House.
[02:48.37]KING RICHARD II	Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
[02:51.14]	To help him to his grave immediately!
[02:53.80]	The lining of his coffers shall make coats
[02:56.82]	To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
[02:59.78]	Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
[03:02.49]	Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!
[03:05.64]All	Amen.
[03:06.32]	[Exeunt]
