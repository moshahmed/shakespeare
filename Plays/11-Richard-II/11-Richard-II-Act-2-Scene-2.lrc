[00:00.41]	[The palace.,]
[00:01.24]	[Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT]
[00:02.07]BUSHY	Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
[00:04.91]	You promised, when you parted with the king,
[00:08.31]	To lay aside life-harming heaviness
[00:11.22]	And entertain a cheerful disposition.
[00:14.20]QUEEN	To please the king I did; to please myself
[00:17.53]	I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
[00:20.37]	Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
[00:23.76]	Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
[00:27.09]	As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
[00:30.21]	Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
[00:33.53]	Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
[00:36.72]	With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
[00:40.39]	More than with parting from my lord the king.
[00:43.93]BUSHY	Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
[00:47.53]	Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
[00:50.99]	For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
[00:54.46]	Divides one thing entire to many objects;
[00:57.72]	Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
[01:01.11]	Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
[01:04.09]	Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
[01:07.21]	Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
[01:10.40]	Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
[01:14.07]	Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
[01:17.74]	Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
[01:21.28]	More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
[01:25.64]	Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
[01:28.83]	Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
[01:32.36]QUEEN	It may be so; but yet my inward soul
[01:35.27]	Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
[01:38.67]	I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
[01:41.37]	As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
[01:44.84]	Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
[01:48.37]BUSHY	'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
[01:51.63]QUEEN	'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
[01:54.95]	From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
[01:58.28]	For nothing had begot my something grief;
[02:01.53]	Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
[02:05.00]	'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
[02:07.84]	But what it is, that is not yet known; what
[02:11.17]	I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.
[02:14.15]	[Enter GREEN]
[02:14.98]GREEN	God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
[02:18.51]	I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
[02:22.18]QUEEN	Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
[02:25.44]	For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
[02:29.18]	Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
[02:32.92]GREEN	That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
[02:36.53]	And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
[02:39.72]	Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
[02:43.11]	The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
[02:46.37]	And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
[02:49.49]	At Ravenspurgh.
[02:50.94]QUEEN	Now God in heaven forbid!
[02:53.09]GREEN	Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
[02:56.28]	The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
[03:00.16]	The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
[03:03.48]	With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.
[03:07.22]BUSHY	Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
[03:10.62]	And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
[03:14.02]GREEN	We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
[03:17.20]	Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
[03:20.81]	And all the household servants fled with him
[03:24.34]	To Bolingbroke.
[03:25.79]QUEEN	So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
[03:28.98]	And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
[03:32.17]	Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
[03:35.57]	And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
[03:38.54]	Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.
[03:41.73]BUSHY	Despair not, madam.
[03:43.40]QUEEN	Who shall hinder me?
[03:45.20]	I will despair, and be at enmity
[03:47.83]	With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
[03:50.81]	A parasite, a keeper back of death,
[03:53.58]	Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
[03:57.05]	Which false hope lingers in extremity.
[04:00.09]	[Enter DUKE OF YORK]
[04:00.93]GREEN	Here comes the Duke of York.
[04:03.28]QUEEN	With signs of war about his aged neck:
[04:06.33]	O, full of careful business are his looks!
[04:09.59]	Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.
[04:13.12]DUKE OF YORK	Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
[04:16.45]	Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
[04:19.91]	Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
[04:23.65]	Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
[04:26.84]	Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
[04:30.31]	Here am I left to underprop his land,
[04:33.29]	Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
[04:36.47]	Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
[04:40.08]	Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.
[04:43.82]	[Enter a Servant]
[04:44.65]Servant	My lord, your son was gone before I came.
[04:47.84]DUKE OF YORK	He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
[04:50.96]	The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
[04:54.91]	And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
[04:58.23]	Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
[05:02.11]	Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
[05:05.51]	Hold, take my ring.
[05:07.17]Servant	My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
[05:10.57]	To-day, as I came by, I called there;
[05:13.41]	But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
[05:16.73]DUKE OF YORK	What is't, knave?
[05:18.26]Servant	An hour before I came, the duchess died.
[05:21.38]DUKE OF YORK	God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
[05:24.42]	Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
[05:27.75]	I know not what to do: I would to God,
[05:30.73]	So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
[05:33.99]	The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
[05:37.66]	What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
[05:41.33]	How shall we do for money for these wars?
[05:44.59]	Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
[05:48.19]	Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
[05:51.59]	And bring away the armour that is there.
[05:54.77]	[Exit Servant]
[05:55.61]	Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
[05:58.31]	If I know how or which way to order these affairs
[06:02.19]	Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
[06:05.17]	Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
[06:08.15]	The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
[06:11.47]	And duty bids defend; the other again
[06:14.45]	Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
[06:17.71]	Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
[06:21.24]	Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
[06:24.57]	Dispose of you.
[06:26.03]	Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
[06:28.66]	And meet me presently at Berkeley.
[06:31.43]	I should to Plashy too;
[06:33.44]	But time will not permit: all is uneven,
[06:36.56]	And every thing is left at six and seven.
[06:39.82]	[Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN]
[06:40.65]BUSHY	The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
[06:44.18]	But none returns. For us to levy power
[06:47.23]	Proportionable to the enemy
[06:49.59]	Is all unpossible.
[06:51.25]GREEN	Besides, our nearness to the king in love
[06:54.51]	Is near the hate of those love not the king.
[06:57.97]BAGOT	And that's the wavering commons: for their love
[07:01.64]	Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
[07:05.11]	By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
[07:08.78]BUSHY	Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
[07:12.24]BAGOT	If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
[07:15.36]	Because we ever have been near the king.
[07:18.55]GREEN	Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
[07:22.43]	The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
[07:25.55]BUSHY	Thither will I with you; for little office
[07:28.87]	The hateful commons will perform for us,
[07:32.06]	Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
[07:35.39]	Will you go along with us?
[07:37.61]BAGOT	No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
[07:40.52]	Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
[07:43.77]	We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.
[07:47.38]BUSHY	That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
[07:51.12]GREEN	Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
[07:54.17]	Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
[07:57.56]	Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
[08:01.30]	Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.
[08:04.70]BUSHY	Well, we may meet again.
[08:06.71]BAGOT	I fear me, never.
[08:08.23]	[Exeunt]
