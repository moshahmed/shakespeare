[00:00.38]	[Wilds in Gloucestershire.,]
[00:01.16]	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces]
[00:01.93]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
[00:04.78]NORTHUMBERLAND	Believe me, noble lord,
[00:06.59]	I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
[00:09.56]	These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
[00:12.80]	Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
[00:16.10]	And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
[00:19.52]	Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
[00:22.56]	But I bethink me what a weary way
[00:25.15]	From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
[00:28.32]	In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
[00:31.55]	Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
[00:34.52]	The tediousness and process of my travel:
[00:37.56]	But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
[00:40.92]	The present benefit which I possess;
[00:43.64]	And hope to joy is little less in joy
[00:46.49]	Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
[00:49.59]	Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
[00:53.21]	By sight of what I have, your noble company.
[00:56.38]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Of much less value is my company
[00:58.90]	Than your good words. But who comes here?
[01:01.87]	[Enter HENRY PERCY]
[01:02.65]NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my son, young Harry Percy,
[01:05.04]	Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
[01:08.28]	Harry, how fares your uncle?
[01:10.41]HENRY PERCY	I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
[01:14.42]NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, is he not with the queen?
[01:16.68]HENRY PERCY	No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
[01:19.78]	Broken his staff of office and dispersed
[01:22.82]	The household of the king.
[01:24.89]NORTHUMBERLAND	What was his reason?
[01:26.57]	He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
[01:30.26]HENRY PERCY	Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
[01:33.56]	But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
[01:36.40]	To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
[01:39.44]	And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
[01:42.48]	What power the Duke of York had levied there;
[01:45.78]	Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
[01:49.14]NORTHUMBERLAND	Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
[01:52.18]HENRY PERCY	No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
[01:55.09]	Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
[01:58.26]	I never in my life did look on him.
[02:00.91]NORTHUMBERLAND	Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
[02:04.14]HENRY PERCY	My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
[02:07.18]	Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
[02:10.22]	Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
[02:13.26]	To more approved service and desert.
[02:15.97]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
[02:18.82]	I count myself in nothing else so happy
[02:21.79]	As in a soul remembering my good friends;
[02:24.83]	And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
[02:27.74]	It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
[02:31.04]	My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.
[02:34.73]NORTHUMBERLAND	How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
[02:37.70]	Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
[02:41.06]HENRY PERCY	There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
[02:44.36]	Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
[02:47.72]	And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
[02:51.54]	None else of name and noble estimate.
[02:54.32]	[Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY]
[02:55.09]NORTHUMBERLAND	Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
[02:58.26]	Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.
[03:01.36]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
[03:04.40]	A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
[03:07.05]	Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
[03:10.35]	Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
[03:13.52]LORD ROSS	Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
[03:16.75]LORD WILLOUGHBY	And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
[03:19.86]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
[03:22.96]	Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
[03:26.19]	Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?
[03:29.17]	[Enter LORD BERKELEY]
[03:29.94]NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
[03:32.72]LORD BERKELEY	My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
[03:35.76]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
[03:38.35]	And I am come to seek that name in England;
[03:41.52]	And I must find that title in your tongue,
[03:44.62]	Before I make reply to aught you say.
[03:47.40]LORD BERKELEY	Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
[03:50.51]	To raze one title of your honour out:
[03:53.29]	To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
[03:56.33]	From the most gracious regent of this land,
[03:59.49]	The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
[04:02.73]	To take advantage of the absent time
[04:05.51]	And fright our native peace with self-born arms.
[04:09.00]	[Enter DUKE OF YORK attended]
[04:09.77]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I shall not need transport my words by you;
[04:12.94]	Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!
[04:16.30]	[Kneels]
[04:17.08]DUKE OF YORK	Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
[04:20.18]	Whose duty is deceiveable and false.
[04:22.90]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle--
[04:24.45]DUKE OF YORK	Tut, tut!
[04:25.36]	Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
[04:28.33]	I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
[04:31.56]	In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
[04:34.41]	Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
[04:37.58]	Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
[04:41.00]	But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
[04:44.43]	So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
[04:47.28]	Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
[04:50.45]	And ostentation of despised arms?
[04:52.97]	Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
[04:56.39]	Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
[04:59.37]	And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
[05:02.15]	Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
[05:05.25]	As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
[05:08.36]	Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
[05:11.85]	From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
[05:15.15]	O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
[05:18.31]	Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
[05:21.29]	And minister correction to thy fault!
[05:24.07]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
[05:26.98]	On what condition stands it and wherein?
[05:29.95]DUKE OF YORK	Even in condition of the worst degree,
[05:32.80]	In gross rebellion and detested treason:
[05:35.77]	Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
[05:38.88]	Before the expiration of thy time,
[05:41.46]	In braving arms against thy sovereign.
[05:44.31]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
[05:47.41]	But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
[05:50.06]	And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
[05:52.84]	Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
[05:55.95]	You are my father, for methinks in you
[05:58.79]	I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
[06:01.70]	Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
[06:05.00]	A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
[06:08.30]	Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
[06:11.59]	To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
[06:14.70]	If that my cousin king be King of England,
[06:17.80]	It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
[06:20.90]	You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
[06:23.81]	Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
[06:27.18]	He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
[06:30.54]	To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
[06:33.90]	I am denied to sue my livery here,
[06:36.49]	And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
[06:39.53]	My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
[06:42.89]	And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
[06:45.93]	What would you have me do? I am a subject,
[06:48.97]	And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
[06:52.20]	And therefore, personally I lay my claim
[06:55.17]	To my inheritance of free descent.
[06:57.76]NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble duke hath been too much abused.
[07:00.80]LORD ROSS	It stands your grace upon to do him right.
[07:03.90]LORD WILLOUGHBY	Base men by his endowments are made great.
[07:07.01]DUKE OF YORK	My lords of England, let me tell you this:
[07:10.04]	I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
[07:13.08]	And laboured all I could to do him right;
[07:16.12]	But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
[07:19.16]	Be his own carver and cut out his way,
[07:22.01]	To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
[07:25.18]	And you that do abet him in this kind
[07:28.02]	Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
[07:30.80]NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
[07:33.77]	But for his own; and for the right of that
[07:36.88]	We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
[07:40.05]	And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
[07:43.54]DUKE OF YORK	Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
[07:46.51]	I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
[07:49.36]	Because my power is weak and all ill left:
[07:52.46]	But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
[07:55.44]	I would attach you all and make you stoop
[07:58.54]	Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
[08:01.32]	But since I cannot, be it known to you
[08:04.16]	I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
[08:07.07]	Unless you please to enter in the castle
[08:10.11]	And there repose you for this night.
[08:12.83]HENRY BOLINGBROKE	An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
[08:15.48]	But we must win your grace to go with us
[08:18.52]	To Bristol castle, which they say is held
[08:21.56]	By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
[08:24.21]	The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
[08:26.99]	Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
[08:30.09]DUKE OF YORK	It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
[08:33.58]	For I am loath to break our country's laws.
[08:36.75]	Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
[08:39.92]	Things past redress are now with me past care.
[08:43.28]	[Exeunt]
