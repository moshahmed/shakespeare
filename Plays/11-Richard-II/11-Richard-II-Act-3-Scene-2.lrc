[00:00.44]	[The coast of Wales. A castle in view.,]
[00:01.32]	[Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD
[00:01.76]	+ II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, and Soldiers]
[00:02.20]KING RICHARD II	Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
[00:05.72]DUKE OF AUMERLE	Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
[00:09.24]	After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
[00:12.98]KING RICHARD II	Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
[00:16.43]	To stand upon my kingdom once again.
[00:19.51]	Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
[00:22.96]	Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
[00:26.99]	As a long-parted mother with her child
[00:30.29]	Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
[00:34.40]	So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
[00:37.85]	And do thee favours with my royal hands.
[00:41.22]	Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
[00:44.97]	Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
[00:48.85]	But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
[00:52.45]	And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
[00:55.82]	Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
[00:59.20]	Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
[01:02.72]	Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
[01:06.02]	And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
[01:09.69]	Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
[01:13.21]	Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
[01:16.88]	Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
[01:20.33]	Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
[01:23.70]	This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
[01:27.73]	Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
[01:31.18]	Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
[01:34.63]BISHOP OF CARLISLE	Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
[01:38.52]	Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
[01:42.19]	The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
[01:46.00]	And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
[01:49.30]	And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
[01:52.75]	The proffer'd means of succor and redress.
[01:56.27]DUKE OF AUMERLE	He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
[01:59.65]	Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
[02:03.02]	Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
[02:07.06]KING RICHARD II	Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
[02:10.36]	That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
[02:14.10]	Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
[02:17.84]	Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
[02:21.58]	In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
[02:24.81]	But when from under this terrestrial ball
[02:28.33]	He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
[02:32.07]	And darts his light through every guilty hole,
[02:35.89]	Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
[02:39.26]	The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
[02:43.66]	Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
[02:47.40]	So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
[02:51.07]	Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
[02:54.89]	Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
[02:58.56]	Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
[03:02.15]	His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
[03:05.74]	Not able to endure the sight of day,
[03:08.83]	But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
[03:12.13]	Not all the water in the rough rude sea
[03:15.50]	Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
[03:19.17]	The breath of worldly men cannot depose
[03:22.54]	The deputy elected by the Lord:
[03:25.26]	For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
[03:28.93]	To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
[03:32.74]	God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
[03:36.19]	A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
[03:39.42]	Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
[03:43.75]	[Enter EARL OF SALISBURY]
[03:44.63]	Welcome, my lord
[03:46.24]	how far off lies your power?
[03:48.73]EARL OF SALISBURY	Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
[03:52.26]	Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
[03:56.14]	And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
[03:59.59]	One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
[04:02.82]	Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
[04:06.27]	O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
[04:09.50]	And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
[04:13.53]	To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
[04:16.54]	O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
[04:20.65]	For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
[04:24.31]	Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.
[04:27.91]DUKE OF AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
[04:31.72]KING RICHARD II	But now the blood of twenty thousand men
[04:35.17]	Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
[04:38.62]	And, till so much blood thither come again,
[04:42.14]	Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
[04:45.52]	All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
[04:49.26]	For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
[04:52.56]DUKE OF AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
[04:55.79]KING RICHARD II	I had forgot myself; am I not king?
[04:58.72]	Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
[05:02.10]	Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
[05:05.84]	Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
[05:09.14]	At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
[05:12.66]	Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
[05:16.03]	High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
[05:19.56]	Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
[05:24.03]	[Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP]
[05:24.91]SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	More health and happiness betide my liege
[05:28.43]	Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
[05:31.95]KING RICHARD II	Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
[05:35.25]	The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
[05:38.92]	Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
[05:42.30]	And what loss is it to be rid of care?
[05:45.52]	Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
[05:48.97]	Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
[05:52.35]	We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
[05:55.80]	Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
[05:59.17]	They break their faith to God as well as us:
[06:02.84]	Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
[06:05.85]	The worst is death, and death will have his day.
[06:09.73]SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
[06:13.18]	To bear the tidings of calamity.
[06:15.97]	Like an unseasonable stormy day,
[06:18.76]	Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
[06:22.79]	As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
[06:26.46]	So high above his limits swells the rage
[06:29.91]	Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
[06:33.43]	With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
[06:37.68]	White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
[06:42.16]	Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
[06:45.90]	Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
[06:49.94]	In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
[06:53.38]	The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
[06:56.98]	Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
[07:00.21]	Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
[07:03.36]	Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
[07:06.88]	And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
[07:10.62]KING RICHARD II	Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
[07:14.36]	Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
[07:18.18]	What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
[07:21.48]	That they have let the dangerous enemy
[07:24.78]	Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
[07:28.60]	If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
[07:32.19]	I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.
[07:36.15]SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
[07:39.89]KING RICHARD II	O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
[07:43.56]	Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
[07:46.57]	Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
[07:50.83]	Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
[07:54.71]	Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
[07:58.45]	Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
[08:01.98]SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
[08:05.28]	Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
[08:08.80]	Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
[08:12.61]	With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
[08:16.79]	Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
[08:20.76]	And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.
[08:24.50]DUKE OF AUMERLE	Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
[08:28.31]SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
[08:31.91]DUKE OF AUMERLE	Where is the duke my father with his power?
[08:35.50]KING RICHARD II	No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
[08:38.88]	Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
[08:42.47]	Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
[08:45.85]	Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
[08:49.15]	Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
[08:52.60]	And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
[08:55.97]	Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
[08:59.20]	Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
[09:03.01]	And nothing can we call our own but death
[09:06.53]	And that small model of the barren earth
[09:09.98]	Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
[09:13.72]	For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
[09:17.24]	And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
[09:20.84]	How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
[09:24.58]	Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
[09:28.32]	Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
[09:32.43]	All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
[09:35.88]	That rounds the mortal temples of a king
[09:39.33]	Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
[09:43.21]	Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
[09:46.88]	Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
[09:50.04]	To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
[09:53.70]	Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
[09:57.08]	As if this flesh which walls about our life,
[10:00.75]	Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
[10:04.20]	Comes at the last and with a little pin
[10:07.57]	Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
[10:11.53]	Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
[10:15.35]	With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
[10:18.79]	Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
[10:21.88]	For you have but mistook me all this while:
[10:25.47]	I live with bread like you, feel want,
[10:28.62]	Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
[10:32.00]	How can you say to me, I am a king?
[10:34.93]BISHOP OF CARLISLE	My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
[10:38.82]	But presently prevent the ways to wail.
[10:42.12]	To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
[10:46.01]	Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
[10:49.83]	And so your follies fight against yourself.
[10:53.42]	Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
[10:57.16]	And fight and die is death destroying death;
[11:00.83]	Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
[11:04.64]DUKE OF AUMERLE	My father hath a power; inquire of him
[11:07.87]	And learn to make a body of a limb.
[11:10.88]KING RICHARD II	Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
[11:14.70]	To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
[11:18.51]	This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
[11:21.59]	An easy task it is to win our own.
[11:24.53]	Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
[11:28.41]	Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.
[11:32.15]SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Men judge by the complexion of the sky
[11:35.46]	The state and inclination of the day:
[11:38.61]	So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
[11:41.69]	My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
[11:45.14]	I play the torturer, by small and small
[11:48.44]	To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
[11:52.26]	Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
[11:55.85]	And all your northern castles yielded up,
[11:59.30]	And all your southern gentlemen in arms
[12:02.67]	Upon his party.
[12:04.21]KING RICHARD II	Thou hast said enough.
[12:06.27]	Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
[12:10.08]	[To DUKE OF AUMERLE]
[12:10.96]	Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
[12:14.19]	What say you now? what comfort have we now?
[12:17.71]	By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
[12:20.94]	That bids me be of comfort any more.
[12:24.02]	Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
[12:27.40]	A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
[12:30.84]	That power I have, discharge; and let them go
[12:34.51]	To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
[12:38.18]	For I have none: let no man speak again
[12:41.48]	To alter this, for counsel is but vain.
[12:44.71]DUKE OF AUMERLE	My liege, one word.
[12:46.47]KING RICHARD II	He does me double wrong
[12:48.67]	That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
[12:52.71]	Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
[12:56.30]	From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.
[13:00.19]	[Exeunt]
