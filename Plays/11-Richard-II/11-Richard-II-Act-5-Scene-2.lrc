[00:00.41]	[The DUKE OF YORK's palace.,]
[00:01.25]	[Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK]
[00:02.09]DUCHESS OF YORK	My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
[00:05.59]	When weeping made you break the story off,
[00:08.94]	of our two cousins coming into London.
[00:12.02]DUKE OF YORK	Where did I leave?
[00:13.70]DUCHESS OF YORK	At that sad stop, my lord,
[00:15.86]	Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
[00:19.57]	Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
[00:23.20]DUKE OF YORK	Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
[00:26.56]	Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
[00:29.43]	Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
[00:32.64]	With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
[00:36.28]	Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
[00:39.42]	Bolingbroke!'
[00:40.68]	You would have thought the very windows spake,
[00:44.32]	So many greedy looks of young and old
[00:47.39]	Through casements darted their desiring eyes
[00:50.96]	Upon his visage, and that all the walls
[00:54.10]	With painted imagery had said at once
[00:57.18]	'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
[01:00.33]	Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
[01:04.17]	Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
[01:07.74]	Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
[01:11.02]	And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.
[01:14.38]DUCHESS OF YORK	Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
[01:17.87]DUKE OF YORK	As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
[01:20.53]	After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
[01:23.95]	Are idly bent on him that enters next,
[01:27.03]	Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
[01:29.90]	Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
[01:33.53]	Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
[01:37.73]	No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
[01:41.15]	But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
[01:44.44]	Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
[01:47.86]	His face still combating with tears and smiles,
[01:51.57]	The badges of his grief and patience,
[01:54.57]	That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
[01:58.42]	The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
[02:02.26]	And barbarism itself have pitied him.
[02:05.27]	But heaven hath a hand in these events,
[02:08.42]	To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
[02:12.05]	To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
[02:15.34]	Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
[02:18.48]DUCHESS OF YORK	Here comes my son Aumerle.
[02:20.72]DUKE OF YORK	Aumerle that was;
[02:22.33]	But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
[02:25.82]	And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
[02:29.04]	I am in parliament pledge for his truth
[02:32.25]	And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
[02:35.47]	[Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE]
[02:36.31]DUCHESS OF YORK	Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
[02:39.45]	That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
[02:43.23]DUKE OF AUMERLE	Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
[02:46.45]	God knows I had as lief be none as one.
[02:49.59]DUKE OF YORK	Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
[02:53.23]	Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
[02:56.79]	What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?
[03:00.85]DUKE OF AUMERLE	For aught I know, my lord, they do.
[03:03.57]DUKE OF YORK	You will be there, I know.
[03:05.74]DUKE OF AUMERLE	If God prevent not, I purpose so.
[03:08.40]DUKE OF YORK	What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
[03:12.10]	Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.
[03:15.67]DUKE OF AUMERLE	My lord, 'tis nothing.
[03:17.48]DUKE OF YORK	No matter, then, who see it;
[03:19.72]	I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
[03:23.15]DUKE OF AUMERLE	I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
[03:26.15]	It is a matter of small consequence,
[03:29.09]	Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
[03:32.65]DUKE OF YORK	Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
[03:35.94]	I fear, I fear,--
[03:37.34]DUCHESS OF YORK	What should you fear?
[03:39.23]	'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
[03:43.14]	For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
[03:46.29]DUKE OF YORK	Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
[03:49.64]	That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
[03:52.93]	Boy, let me see the writing.
[03:55.23]DUKE OF AUMERLE	I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
[03:58.80]DUKE OF YORK	I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
[04:02.02]	[He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it]
[04:02.85]	Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
[04:06.28]DUCHESS OF YORK	What is the matter, my lord?
[04:08.59]DUKE OF YORK	Ho! who is within there?
[04:10.61]	[Enter a Servant]
[04:11.45]	Saddle my horse.
[04:12.99]	God for his mercy, what treachery is here!
[04:16.28]DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, what is it, my lord?
[04:18.30]DUKE OF YORK	Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
[04:21.45]	Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
[04:24.81]	I will appeach the villain.
[04:27.11]DUCHESS OF YORK	What is the matter?
[04:28.86]DUKE OF YORK	Peace, foolish woman.
[04:30.68]DUCHESS OF YORK	I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.
[04:34.17]DUKE OF AUMERLE	Good mother, be content; it is no more
[04:37.18]	Than my poor life must answer.
[04:39.70]DUCHESS OF YORK	Thy life answer!
[04:41.23]DUKE OF YORK	Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
[04:44.38]	[Re-enter Servant with boots]
[04:45.22]DUCHESS OF YORK	Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
[04:48.71]	Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.
[04:52.07]DUKE OF YORK	Give me my boots, I say.
[04:54.10]DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, York, what wilt thou do?
[04:56.40]	Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
[04:59.97]	Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
[05:03.25]	Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
[05:06.61]	And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
[05:10.25]	And rob me of a happy mother's name?
[05:13.18]	Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
[05:16.40]DUKE OF YORK	Thou fond mad woman,
[05:18.22]	Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
[05:21.36]	A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
[05:25.00]	And interchangeably set down their hands,
[05:28.28]	To kill the king at Oxford.
[05:30.59]DUCHESS OF YORK	He shall be none;
[05:32.20]	We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?
[05:35.76]DUKE OF YORK	Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
[05:39.26]	I would appeach him.
[05:41.07]DUCHESS OF YORK	Hadst thou groan'd for him
[05:43.38]	As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
[05:46.88]	But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
[05:50.23]	That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
[05:53.24]	And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
[05:56.24]	Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
[05:59.81]	He is as like thee as a man may be,
[06:02.68]	Not like to me, or any of my kin,
[06:05.33]	And yet I love him.
[06:07.08]DUKE OF YORK	Make way, unruly woman!
[06:09.04]	[Exit]
[06:09.88]DUCHESS OF YORK	After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
[06:13.09]	Spur post, and get before him to the king,
[06:16.38]	And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
[06:19.66]	I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
[06:22.88]	I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
[06:26.10]	And never will I rise up from the ground
[06:29.38]	Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!
[06:33.23]	[Exeunt]
