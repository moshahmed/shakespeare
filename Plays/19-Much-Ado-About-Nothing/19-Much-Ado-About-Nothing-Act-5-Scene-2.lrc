[00:00.39]	[LEONATO'S garden.,]
[00:01.19]	[Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting]
[00:01.99]BENEDICK	Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
[00:05.71]	my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
[00:09.37]MARGARET	Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
[00:13.43]BENEDICK	In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
[00:16.95]	shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
[00:20.61]	deservest it.
[00:21.87]MARGARET	To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
[00:25.40]	keep below stairs?
[00:26.99]BENEDICK	Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
[00:31.12]MARGARET	And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
[00:34.91]	but hurt not.
[00:36.17]BENEDICK	A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
[00:39.56]	woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
[00:43.02]	thee the bucklers.
[00:44.62]MARGARET	Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
[00:48.14]BENEDICK	If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
[00:51.53]	pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
[00:55.85]MARGARET	Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
[00:59.91]BENEDICK	And therefore will come.
[01:01.91]	[Exit MARGARET]
[01:02.70]	[Sings]
[01:03.50]	The god of love,
[01:04.97]	That sits above,
[01:06.43]	And knows me, and knows me,
[01:08.56]	How pitiful I deserve,--
[01:10.42]	I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
[01:14.08]	swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
[01:17.80]	a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
[01:21.39]	whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
[01:25.18]	blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
[01:28.77]	over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
[01:32.23]	cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
[01:35.82]	out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
[01:39.01]	rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
[01:41.94]	'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
[01:45.13]	endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
[01:48.79]	nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
[01:51.51]	[Enter BEATRICE]
[01:52.31]	Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
[01:56.17]BEATRICE	Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
[01:59.16]BENEDICK	O, stay but till then!
[02:00.96]BEATRICE	'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
[02:04.35]	I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
[02:07.81]	knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
[02:11.46]BENEDICK	Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
[02:14.99]BEATRICE	Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
[02:18.65]	foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
[02:22.44]	will depart unkissed.
[02:24.23]BENEDICK	Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
[02:28.02]	so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
[02:31.35]	plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
[02:35.07]	I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
[02:38.73]	him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
[02:42.12]	which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
[02:46.51]BEATRICE	For them all together; which maintained so politic
[02:50.23]	a state of evil that they will not admit any good
[02:53.96]	part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
[02:57.68]	good parts did you first suffer love for me?
[03:01.01]BENEDICK	Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
[03:04.33]	indeed, for I love thee against my will.
[03:07.32]BEATRICE	In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
[03:10.85]	If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
[03:14.44]	yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.
[03:18.50]BENEDICK	Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
[03:21.62]BEATRICE	It appears not in this confession: there's not one
[03:25.35]	wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
[03:28.87]BENEDICK	An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
[03:32.33]	the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
[03:36.05]	in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
[03:39.84]	no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
[03:43.57]	widow weeps.
[03:44.76]BEATRICE	And how long is that, think you?
[03:47.22]BENEDICK	Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
[03:50.88]	rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
[03:54.27]	wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
[03:57.33]	impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
[04:01.19]	own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
[04:04.38]	praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
[04:08.11]	praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?
[04:11.83]BEATRICE	Very ill.
[04:12.83]BENEDICK	And how do you?
[04:14.22]BEATRICE	Very ill too.
[04:15.49]BENEDICK	Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
[04:18.94]	you too, for here comes one in haste.
[04:21.74]	[Enter URSULA]
[04:22.54]URSULA	Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
[04:26.06]	coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
[04:29.72]	falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
[04:33.31]	abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
[04:36.90]	fed and gone. Will you come presently?
[04:39.76]BEATRICE	Will you go hear this news, signior?
[04:42.49]BENEDICK	I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
[04:46.01]	buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
[04:49.53]	thee to thy uncle's.
[04:51.26]	[Exeunt]
