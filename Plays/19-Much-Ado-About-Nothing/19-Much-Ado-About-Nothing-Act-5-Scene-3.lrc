[00:00.73]	[A church.,]
[00:02.19]	[Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four
[00:02.93]	+ with tapers]
[00:03.66]CLAUDIO	Is this the monument of Leonato?
[00:08.30]Lord	It is, my lord.
[00:10.74]CLAUDIO	[Reading out of a scroll]
[00:12.20]	Done to death by slanderous tongues
[00:17.33]	Was the Hero that here lies:
[00:21.48]	Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
[00:26.00]	Gives her fame which never dies.
[00:30.64]	So the life that died with shame
[00:35.40]	Lives in death with glorious fame.
[00:40.29]	Hang thou there upon the tomb,
[00:44.68]	Praising her when I am dumb.
[00:48.83]	Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
[00:54.69]	SONG.
[00:56.04]	Pardon, goddess of the night,
[01:00.19]	Those that slew thy virgin knight;
[01:05.07]	For the which, with songs of woe,
[01:09.71]	Round about her tomb they go.
[01:13.99]	Midnight, assist our moan;
[01:17.77]	Help us to sigh and groan,
[01:21.68]	Heavily, heavily:
[01:24.36]	Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
[01:29.00]	Till death be uttered,
[01:32.42]	Heavily, heavily.
[01:35.11]CLAUDIO	Now, unto thy bones good night!
[01:39.50]	Yearly will I do this rite.
[01:43.53]DON PEDRO	Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
[01:49.27]	The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
[01:55.74]	Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
[02:01.48]	Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
[02:07.46]	Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
[02:13.69]CLAUDIO	Good morrow, masters: each his several way.
[02:19.43]DON PEDRO	Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
[02:25.17]	And then to Leonato's we will go.
[02:29.93]CLAUDIO	And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
[02:35.67]	Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.
[02:41.65]	[Exeunt]
