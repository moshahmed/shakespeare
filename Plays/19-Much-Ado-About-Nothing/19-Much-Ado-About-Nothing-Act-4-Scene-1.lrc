[00:00.37]	[A church.,]
[00:01.12]	[Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS,
[00:01.50]	+ CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants]
[00:01.88]LEONATO	Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain
[00:05.14]	form of marriage, and you shall recount their
[00:08.34]	particular duties afterwards.
[00:10.54]FRIAR FRANCIS	You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.
[00:13.62]CLAUDIO	No.
[00:14.18]LEONATO	To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.
[00:17.63]FRIAR FRANCIS	Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.
[00:21.09]HERO	I do.
[00:21.78]FRIAR FRANCIS	If either of you know any inward impediment why you
[00:25.42]	should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
[00:28.87]	to utter it.
[00:30.00]CLAUDIO	Know you any, Hero?
[00:31.51]HERO	None, my lord.
[00:32.70]FRIAR FRANCIS	Know you any, count?
[00:34.27]LEONATO	I dare make his answer, none.
[00:36.40]CLAUDIO	O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
[00:39.92]	do, not knowing what they do!
[00:42.05]BENEDICK	How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
[00:45.07]	laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
[00:46.76]CLAUDIO	Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
[00:49.71]	Will you with free and unconstrained soul
[00:52.72]	Give me this maid, your daughter?
[00:55.11]LEONATO	As freely, son, as God did give her me.
[00:57.81]CLAUDIO	And what have I to give you back, whose worth
[01:01.01]	May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
[01:04.21]DON PEDRO	Nothing, unless you render her again.
[01:06.85]CLAUDIO	Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
[01:10.05]	There, Leonato, take her back again:
[01:12.56]	Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
[01:15.63]	She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
[01:18.96]	Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
[01:21.85]	O, what authority and show of truth
[01:24.42]	Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
[01:27.06]	Comes not that blood as modest evidence
[01:29.95]	To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
[01:33.15]	All you that see her, that she were a maid,
[01:36.16]	By these exterior shows? But she is none:
[01:39.05]	She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
[01:41.81]	Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
[01:44.45]LEONATO	What do you mean, my lord?
[01:46.39]CLAUDIO	Not to be married,
[01:47.90]	Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
[01:50.91]LEONATO	Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
[01:53.67]	Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
[01:56.81]	And made defeat of her virginity,--
[01:59.26]CLAUDIO	I know what you would say: if I have known her,
[02:02.53]	You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
[02:05.73]	And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
[02:08.24]	No, Leonato,
[02:09.30]	I never tempted her with word too large;
[02:12.19]	But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
[02:14.95]	Bashful sincerity and comely love.
[02:17.47]HERO	And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
[02:20.04]CLAUDIO	Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
[02:23.18]	You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
[02:25.69]	As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
[02:28.58]	But you are more intemperate in your blood
[02:31.65]	Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
[02:34.35]	That rage in savage sensuality.
[02:36.67]HERO	Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
[02:39.75]LEONATO	Sweet prince, why speak not you?
[02:42.07]DON PEDRO	What should I speak?
[02:43.70]	I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
[02:46.65]	To link my dear friend to a common stale.
[02:49.60]LEONATO	Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
[02:52.62]DON JOHN	Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
[02:55.88]BENEDICK	This looks not like a nuptial.
[02:58.14]HERO	True! O God!
[02:59.21]CLAUDIO	Leonato, stand I here?
[03:00.90]	Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
[03:04.29]	Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?
[03:07.24]LEONATO	All this is so: but what of this, my lord?
[03:10.13]CLAUDIO	Let me but move one question to your daughter;
[03:13.39]	And, by that fatherly and kindly power
[03:16.16]	That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
[03:19.17]LEONATO	I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
[03:22.12]HERO	O, God defend me! how am I beset!
[03:24.44]	What kind of catechising call you this?
[03:27.27]CLAUDIO	To make you answer truly to your name.
[03:30.03]HERO	Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
[03:32.79]	With any just reproach?
[03:34.61]CLAUDIO	Marry, that can Hero;
[03:36.24]	Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
[03:39.07]	What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
[03:42.21]	Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
[03:45.22]	Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
[03:47.92]HERO	I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
[03:50.93]DON PEDRO	Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
[03:53.51]	I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
[03:56.52]	Myself, my brother and this grieved count
[03:59.47]	Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
[04:02.67]	Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
[04:05.68]	Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
[04:08.82]	Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
[04:11.96]	A thousand times in secret.
[04:14.03]DON JOHN	Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
[04:16.98]	Not to be spoke of;
[04:18.55]	There is not chastity enough in language
[04:21.50]	Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
[04:24.83]	I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
[04:27.59]CLAUDIO	O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
[04:30.16]	If half thy outward graces had been placed
[04:33.24]	About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
[04:36.44]	But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
[04:39.83]	Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
[04:42.53]	For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
[04:45.67]	And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
[04:48.56]	To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
[04:51.51]	And never shall it more be gracious.
[04:54.14]LEONATO	Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
[04:57.09]	[HERO swoons]
[04:57.85]BEATRICE	Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?
[05:00.92]DON JOHN	Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
[05:04.25]	Smother her spirits up.
[05:06.07]	[Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO]
[05:06.82]BENEDICK	How doth the lady?
[05:08.33]BEATRICE	Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
[05:10.21]	Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!
[05:13.29]LEONATO	O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
[05:15.93]	Death is the fairest cover for her shame
[05:18.88]	That may be wish'd for.
[05:20.70]BEATRICE	How now, cousin Hero!
[05:22.33]FRIAR FRANCIS	Have comfort, lady.
[05:23.83]LEONATO	Dost thou look up?
[05:25.34]FRIAR FRANCIS	Yea, wherefore should she not?
[05:27.54]LEONATO	Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
[05:30.61]	Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
[05:33.44]	The story that is printed in her blood?
[05:36.26]	Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
[05:39.09]	For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
[05:42.29]	Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
[05:45.93]	Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
[05:49.01]	Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
[05:52.08]	Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
[05:55.03]	O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
[05:57.73]	Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
[06:00.43]	Why had I not with charitable hand
[06:03.00]	Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
[06:05.70]	Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
[06:08.59]	I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
[06:11.48]	This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
[06:14.68]	But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
[06:17.88]	And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
[06:20.89]	That I myself was to myself not mine,
[06:23.59]	Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
[06:26.42]	Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
[06:29.05]	Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
[06:32.13]	And salt too little which may season give
[06:35.14]	To her foul-tainted flesh!
[06:37.15]BENEDICK	Sir, sir, be patient.
[06:38.72]	For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
[06:41.48]	I know not what to say.
[06:43.30]BEATRICE	O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
[06:45.75]BENEDICK	Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
[06:48.58]BEATRICE	No, truly not; although, until last night,
[06:51.40]	I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
[06:54.48]LEONATO	Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
[06:57.62]	Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
[07:00.82]	Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
[07:03.83]	Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
[07:07.16]	Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
[07:10.55]FRIAR FRANCIS	Hear me a little; for I have only been
[07:13.31]	Silent so long and given way unto
[07:15.82]	This course of fortune [ ]
[07:18.02]	By noting of the lady I have mark'd
[07:20.65]	A thousand blushing apparitions
[07:23.04]	To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
[07:26.55]	In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
[07:29.63]	And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
[07:32.64]	To burn the errors that these princes hold
[07:35.72]	Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
[07:38.61]	Trust not my reading nor my observations,
[07:41.56]	Which with experimental seal doth warrant
[07:44.57]	The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
[07:47.33]	My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
[07:49.84]	If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
[07:52.85]	Under some biting error.
[07:54.74]LEONATO	Friar, it cannot be.
[07:56.31]	Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
[07:59.76]	Is that she will not add to her damnation
[08:02.77]	A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
[08:05.35]	Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
[08:08.42]	That which appears in proper nakedness?
[08:11.25]FRIAR FRANCIS	Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
[08:14.07]HERO	They know that do accuse me; I know none:
[08:16.96]	If I know more of any man alive
[08:19.34]	Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
[08:22.48]	Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
[08:25.31]	Prove you that any man with me conversed
[08:28.26]	At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
[08:31.02]	Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
[08:34.47]	Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
[08:37.23]FRIAR FRANCIS	There is some strange misprision in the princes.
[08:40.62]BENEDICK	Two of them have the very bent of honour;
[08:43.57]	And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
[08:46.40]	The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
[08:49.60]	Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.
[08:52.55]LEONATO	I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
[08:55.56]	These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
[08:59.20]	The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
[09:02.28]	Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
[09:05.54]	Nor age so eat up my invention,
[09:07.87]	Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
[09:10.75]	Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
[09:13.83]	But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
[09:16.84]	Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
[09:19.79]	Ability in means and choice of friends,
[09:22.62]	To quit me of them throughly.
[09:24.82]FRIAR FRANCIS	Pause awhile,
[09:26.01]	And let my counsel sway you in this case.
[09:28.96]	Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
[09:32.16]	Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
[09:34.73]	And publish it that she is dead indeed;
[09:37.56]	Maintain a mourning ostentation
[09:39.94]	And on your family's old monument
[09:42.45]	Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
[09:45.34]	That appertain unto a burial.
[09:47.54]LEONATO	What shall become of this? what will this do?
[09:50.68]FRIAR FRANCIS	Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
[09:53.82]	Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
[09:56.95]	But not for that dream I on this strange course,
[10:00.34]	But on this travail look for greater birth.
[10:03.42]	She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
[10:06.18]	Upon the instant that she was accused,
[10:08.94]	Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
[10:11.64]	Of every hearer: for it so falls out
[10:14.28]	That what we have we prize not to the worth
[10:17.42]	Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
[10:20.62]	Why, then we rack the value, then we find
[10:23.51]	The virtue that possession would not show us
[10:26.71]	Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
[10:30.10]	When he shall hear she died upon his words,
[10:33.17]	The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
[10:36.12]	Into his study of imagination,
[10:38.38]	And every lovely organ of her life
[10:40.96]	Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
[10:44.16]	More moving-delicate and full of life,
[10:46.92]	Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
[10:49.68]	Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
[10:53.01]	If ever love had interest in his liver,
[10:55.83]	And wish he had not so accused her,
[10:58.41]	No, though he thought his accusation true.
[11:01.36]	Let this be so, and doubt not but success
[11:04.31]	Will fashion the event in better shape
[11:07.13]	Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
[11:09.83]	But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
[11:12.85]	The supposition of the lady's death
[11:15.48]	Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
[11:18.18]	And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
[11:21.32]	As best befits her wounded reputation,
[11:24.08]	In some reclusive and religious life,
[11:26.78]	Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.
[11:29.86]BENEDICK	Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
[11:32.81]	And though you know my inwardness and love
[11:35.88]	Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
[11:38.83]	Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
[11:41.66]	As secretly and justly as your soul
[11:44.29]	Should with your body.
[11:46.05]LEONATO	Being that I flow in grief,
[11:48.12]	The smallest twine may lead me.
[11:50.45]FRIAR FRANCIS	'Tis well consented: presently away;
[11:52.96]	For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
[11:56.60]	Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
[11:59.42]	Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
[12:02.94]	[Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE]
[12:03.69]BENEDICK	Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
[12:06.77]BEATRICE	Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
[12:09.34]BENEDICK	I will not desire that.
[12:11.16]BEATRICE	You have no reason; I do it freely.
[12:13.67]BENEDICK	Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
[12:17.06]BEATRICE	Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
[12:21.27]BENEDICK	Is there any way to show such friendship?
[12:24.22]BEATRICE	A very even way, but no such friend.
[12:26.79]BENEDICK	May a man do it?
[12:28.17]BEATRICE	It is a man's office, but not yours.
[12:30.75]BENEDICK	I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
[12:34.20]	not that strange?
[12:35.64]BEATRICE	As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
[12:38.91]	possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
[12:42.42]	you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
[12:45.50]	confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.
[12:49.64]BENEDICK	By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
[12:52.28]BEATRICE	Do not swear, and eat it.
[12:54.16]BENEDICK	I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
[12:57.80]	him eat it that says I love not you.
[13:00.44]BEATRICE	Will you not eat your word?
[13:02.51]BENEDICK	With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
[13:06.02]	I love thee.
[13:07.15]BEATRICE	Why, then, God forgive me!
[13:09.04]BENEDICK	What offence, sweet Beatrice?
[13:11.17]BEATRICE	You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
[13:14.69]	protest I loved you.
[13:16.32]BENEDICK	And do it with all thy heart.
[13:18.51]BEATRICE	I love you with so much of my heart that none is
[13:21.97]	left to protest.
[13:23.35]BENEDICK	Come, bid me do any thing for thee.
[13:25.86]BEATRICE	Kill Claudio.
[13:27.05]BENEDICK	Ha! not for the wide world.
[13:29.06]BEATRICE	You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
[13:31.45]BENEDICK	Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
[13:33.14]BEATRICE	I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
[13:36.47]	you: nay, I pray you, let me go.
[13:38.66]BENEDICK	Beatrice,--
[13:39.61]BEATRICE	In faith, I will go.
[13:41.17]BENEDICK	We'll be friends first.
[13:43.00]BEATRICE	You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
[13:47.26]BENEDICK	Is Claudio thine enemy?
[13:49.08]BEATRICE	Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
[13:52.47]	hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
[13:55.99]	that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
[13:59.57]	come to take hands; and then, with public
[14:02.45]	accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
[14:05.91]	--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
[14:09.17]	in the market-place.
[14:10.80]BENEDICK	Hear me, Beatrice,--
[14:12.25]BEATRICE	Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
[14:15.64]BENEDICK	Nay, but, Beatrice,--
[14:17.08]BEATRICE	Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
[14:21.03]BENEDICK	Beat--
[14:21.73]BEATRICE	Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
[14:25.18]	a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
[14:28.38]	surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
[14:31.89]	had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
[14:35.16]	manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
[14:38.42]	compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
[14:42.00]	trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
[14:45.33]	that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
[14:48.84]	man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
[14:52.99]BENEDICK	Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
[14:56.19]BEATRICE	Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
[14:59.95]BENEDICK	Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
[15:04.03]BEATRICE	Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
[15:07.05]BENEDICK	Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
[15:10.44]	kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
[15:13.76]	Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
[15:17.03]	hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
[15:20.04]	cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.
[15:23.30]	[Exeunt]
