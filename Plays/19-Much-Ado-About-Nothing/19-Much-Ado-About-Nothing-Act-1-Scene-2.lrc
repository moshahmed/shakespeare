[00:00.39]	[A room in LEONATO's house.,]
[00:01.17]	[Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting]
[00:01.96]LEONATO	How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
[00:05.24]	hath he provided this music?
[00:07.47]ANTONIO	He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
[00:11.01]	you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
[00:14.28]LEONATO	Are they good?
[00:15.60]ANTONIO	As the event stamps them: but they have a good
[00:19.00]	cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
[00:22.67]	Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
[00:26.35]	orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
[00:30.02]	the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
[00:33.69]	niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
[00:37.23]	this night in a dance: and if he found her
[00:40.37]	accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
[00:44.11]	top and instantly break with you of it.
[00:47.06]LEONATO	Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
[00:50.27]ANTONIO	A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
[00:53.55]	question him yourself.
[00:55.38]LEONATO	No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
[00:58.92]	itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
[01:02.33]	that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
[01:06.00]	if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
[01:10.00]	[Enter Attendants]
[01:10.79]	Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
[01:14.39]	mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
[01:17.93]	skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
