[00:00.50]	[Windsor Park.,]
[00:01.52]	[Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
[00:02.53]PAGE	Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we
[00:07.18]	see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,
[00:11.91]	my daughter.
[00:13.43]SLENDER	Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a
[00:18.00]	nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in
[00:22.73]	white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by
[00:26.79]	that we know one another.
[00:29.41]SHALLOW	That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'
[00:33.89]	or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well
[00:38.37]	enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.
[00:41.75]PAGE	The night is dark; light and spirits will become it
[00:46.57]	well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil
[00:51.13]	but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.
[00:55.78]	Let's away; follow me.
