[00:00.39]	[A room in PAGE'S house.,]
[00:01.17]	[Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]
[00:01.96]FENTON	I see I cannot get thy father's love;
[00:04.77]	Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
[00:07.97]ANNE PAGE	Alas, how then?
[00:09.28]FENTON	Why, thou must be thyself.
[00:11.31]	He doth object I am too great of birth--,
[00:14.25]	And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
[00:17.72]	I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
[00:20.53]	Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
[00:23.74]	My riots past, my wild societies;
[00:26.22]	And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
[00:28.97]	I should love thee but as a property.
[00:31.78]ANNE PAGE	May be he tells you true.
[00:33.81]FENTON	No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
[00:36.88]	Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
[00:40.02]	Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
[00:43.29]	Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
[00:46.50]	Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
[00:49.70]	And 'tis the very riches of thyself
[00:52.38]	That now I aim at.
[00:53.95]ANNE PAGE	Gentle Master Fenton,
[00:55.72]	Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
[00:58.99]	If opportunity and humblest suit
[01:01.54]	Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!
[01:04.68]	[They converse apart]
[01:05.46]	[Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and MISTRESS QUICKLY]
[01:06.25]SHALLOW	Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall
[01:09.98]	speak for himself.
[01:11.55]SLENDER	I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but
[01:14.95]	venturing.
[01:15.99]SHALLOW	Be not dismayed.
[01:17.43]SLENDER	No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,
[01:20.90]	but that I am afeard.
[01:22.66]MISTRESS QUICKLY	Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.
[01:26.39]ANNE PAGE	I come to him.
[01:27.70]	[Aside]
[01:28.49]	This is my father's choice.
[01:30.64]	O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
[01:33.78]	Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!
[01:37.18]MISTRESS QUICKLY	And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.
[01:41.30]SHALLOW	She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!
[01:44.97]SLENDER	I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you
[01:48.70]	good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress
[01:52.16]	Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of
[01:55.89]	a pen, good uncle.
[01:57.39]SHALLOW	Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
[02:00.01]SLENDER	Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in
[02:03.28]	Gloucestershire.
[02:04.72]SHALLOW	He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
[02:07.73]SLENDER	Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the
[02:11.26]	degree of a squire.
[02:12.89]SHALLOW	He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.
[02:16.75]ANNE PAGE	Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
[02:20.02]SHALLOW	Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good
[02:23.75]	comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.
[02:26.83]ANNE PAGE	Now, Master Slender,--
[02:28.46]SLENDER	Now, good Mistress Anne,--
[02:30.36]ANNE PAGE	What is your will?
[02:31.93]SLENDER	My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
[02:35.26]	indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I
[02:38.86]	am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.
[02:42.59]ANNE PAGE	I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
[02:45.92]SLENDER	Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing
[02:49.59]	with you. Your father and my uncle hath made
[02:52.86]	motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be
[02:56.39]	his dole! They can tell you how things go better
[02:59.92]	than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes.
[03:03.52]	[Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE]
[03:04.30]PAGE	Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
[03:07.44]	Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
[03:10.52]	You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
[03:13.92]	I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.
[03:17.06]FENTON	Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.
[03:19.61]MISTRESS PAGE	Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
[03:22.61]PAGE	She is no match for you.
[03:24.58]FENTON	Sir, will you hear me?
[03:26.34]PAGE	No, good Master Fenton.
[03:28.17]	Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
[03:31.18]	Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
[03:34.39]	[Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
[03:35.17]MISTRESS QUICKLY	Speak to Mistress Page.
[03:37.07]FENTON	Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
[03:40.67]	In such a righteous fashion as I do,
[03:43.41]	Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
[03:47.01]	I must advance the colours of my love
[03:49.89]	And not retire: let me have your good will.
[03:53.03]ANNE PAGE	Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
[03:56.10]MISTRESS PAGE	I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
[03:59.24]MISTRESS QUICKLY	That's my master, master doctor.
[04:01.66]ANNE PAGE	Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
[04:04.87]	And bowl'd to death with turnips!
[04:07.42]MISTRESS PAGE	Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
[04:10.75]	I will not be your friend nor enemy:
[04:13.50]	My daughter will I question how she loves you,
[04:16.90]	And as I find her, so am I affected.
[04:19.58]	Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
[04:22.85]	Her father will be angry.
[04:24.88]FENTON	Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.
[04:27.76]	[Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ANNE PAGE]
[04:28.54]MISTRESS QUICKLY	This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast
[04:31.94]	away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
[04:35.61]	Master Fenton:' this is my doing.
[04:38.02]FENTON	I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
[04:41.23]	Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.
[04:44.89]MISTRESS QUICKLY	Now heaven send thee good fortune!
[04:47.51]	[Exit FENTON]
[04:48.29]	A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through
[04:51.76]	fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
[04:55.23]	would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would
[04:58.56]	Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master
[05:02.22]	Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all
[05:05.82]	three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good
[05:09.42]	as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
[05:13.02]	I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
[05:16.74]	my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!
[05:20.28]	[Exit]
