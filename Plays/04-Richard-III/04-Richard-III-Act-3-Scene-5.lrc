[00:00.40]	[The Tower-walls.,]
[00:01.22]	[Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour,
[00:01.63]	+ marvellous ill-favoured]
[00:02.04]GLOUCESTER	Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
[00:05.93]	Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
[00:09.20]	And then begin again, and stop again,
[00:12.06]	As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
[00:15.67]BUCKINGHAM	Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
[00:18.88]	Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
[00:22.15]	Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
[00:25.29]	Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
[00:28.35]	Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
[00:31.42]	And both are ready in their offices,
[00:34.29]	At any time, to grace my stratagems.
[00:37.08]	But what, is Catesby gone?
[00:39.19]GLOUCESTER	He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
[00:42.33]	[Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY]
[00:43.15]BUCKINGHAM	Lord mayor,--
[00:44.31]GLOUCESTER	Look to the drawbridge there!
[00:46.69]BUCKINGHAM	Hark! a drum.
[00:47.92]GLOUCESTER	Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
[00:50.17]BUCKINGHAM	Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
[00:52.97]GLOUCESTER	Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
[00:56.03]BUCKINGHAM	God and our innocency defend and guard us!
[00:59.31]GLOUCESTER	Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
[01:02.92]	[Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head]
[01:03.74]LOVEL	Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
[01:06.94]	The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
[01:10.01]GLOUCESTER	So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
[01:13.21]	I took him for the plainest harmless creature
[01:16.76]	That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
[01:20.03]	Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
[01:23.30]	The history of all her secret thoughts:
[01:26.37]	So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
[01:30.12]	That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
[01:33.05]	I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
[01:36.32]	He lived from all attainder of suspect.
[01:39.39]BUCKINGHAM	Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
[01:43.14]	That ever lived.
[01:44.64]	Would you imagine, or almost believe,
[01:47.50]	Were't not that, by great preservation,
[01:50.50]	We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
[01:53.78]	This day had plotted, in the council-house
[01:57.05]	To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
[02:00.46]Lord Mayor	What, had he so?
[02:01.89]GLOUCESTER	What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
[02:05.02]	Or that we would, against the form of law,
[02:08.23]	Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
[02:11.57]	But that the extreme peril of the case,
[02:14.64]	The peace of England and our persons' safety,
[02:18.05]	Enforced us to this execution?
[02:20.50]Lord Mayor	Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
[02:23.77]	And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
[02:27.38]	To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
[02:30.93]	I never look'd for better at his hands,
[02:34.00]	After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
[02:37.27]GLOUCESTER	Yet had not we determined he should die,
[02:40.41]	Until your lordship came to see his death;
[02:43.68]	Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
[02:47.36]	Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
[02:50.77]	Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
[02:54.18]	The traitor speak, and timorously confess
[02:57.38]	The manner and the purpose of his treason;
[03:00.65]	That you might well have signified the same
[03:04.06]	Unto the citizens, who haply may
[03:06.65]	Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
[03:09.86]Lord Mayor	But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
[03:13.47]	As well as I had seen and heard him speak
[03:16.74]	And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
[03:20.08]	But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
[03:23.15]	With all your just proceedings in this cause.
[03:26.63]GLOUCESTER	And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
[03:30.17]	To avoid the carping censures of the world.
[03:33.51]BUCKINGHAM	But since you come too late of our intents,
[03:36.85]	Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
[03:39.99]	And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
[03:43.26]	[Exit Lord Mayor]
[03:44.08]GLOUCESTER	Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
[03:46.74]	The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
[03:50.49]	There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
[03:53.90]	Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
[03:57.03]	Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
[04:00.44]	Only for saying he would make his son
[04:03.44]	Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
[04:06.78]	Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
[04:09.92]	Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
[04:12.58]	And bestial appetite in change of lust;
[04:15.64]	Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
[04:19.46]	Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
[04:22.80]	Without control, listed to make his prey.
[04:25.94]	Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
[04:29.35]	Tell them, when that my mother went with child
[04:32.89]	Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
[04:35.75]	My princely father then had wars in France
[04:39.10]	And, by just computation of the time,
[04:41.96]	Found that the issue was not his begot;
[04:45.03]	Which well appeared in his lineaments,
[04:48.03]	Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
[04:51.43]	But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
[04:54.71]	Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
[04:57.91]BUCKINGHAM	Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
[05:00.91]	As if the golden fee for which I plead
[05:03.98]	Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
[05:06.91]GLOUCESTER	If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
[05:10.73]	Where you shall find me well accompanied
[05:13.93]	With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
[05:17.54]BUCKINGHAM	I go: and towards three or four o'clock
[05:20.61]	Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
[05:24.09]	[Exit BUCKINGHAM]
[05:24.91]GLOUCESTER	Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
[05:27.98]	[To CATESBY]
[05:28.79]	Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
[05:31.79]	Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
[05:35.27]	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
[05:36.09]	Now will I in, to take some privy order,
[05:39.16]	To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
[05:42.50]	And to give notice, that no manner of person
[05:45.90]	At any time have recourse unto the princes.
[05:49.25]	[Exit]
