[00:00.54]	[The same.,]
[00:01.62]	[Enter TYRREL]
[00:02.70]TYRREL	The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
[00:06.67]	The most arch of piteous massacre
[00:10.28]	That ever yet this land was guilty of.
[00:14.24]	Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
[00:18.21]	To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
[00:22.18]	Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
[00:27.05]	Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
[00:31.56]	Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
[00:36.70]	'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
[00:41.30]	'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
[00:45.90]	Within their innocent alabaster arms:
[00:49.78]	Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
[00:54.11]	Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
[00:58.89]	A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
[01:02.86]	Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
[01:07.73]	But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
[01:12.05]	Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
[01:16.29]	The most replenished sweet work of nature,
[01:20.62]	That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
[01:25.22]	Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
[01:30.00]	They could not speak; and so I left them both,
[01:34.60]	To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
[01:38.84]	And here he comes.
[01:41.01]	[Enter KING RICHARD III]
[01:42.09]	All hail, my sovereign liege!
[01:45.15]KING RICHARD III	Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
[01:48.85]TYRREL	If to have done the thing you gave in charge
[01:53.45]	Beget your happiness, be happy then,
[01:57.15]	For it is done, my lord.
[01:59.76]KING RICHARD III	But didst thou see them dead?
[02:02.92]TYRREL	I did, my lord.
[02:04.72]KING RICHARD III	And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
[02:07.52]TYRREL	The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
[02:11.94]	But how or in what place I do not know.
[02:16.00]KING RICHARD III	Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
[02:20.06]	And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
[02:24.84]	Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
[02:29.17]	And be inheritor of thy desire.
[02:32.50]	Farewell till soon.
[02:34.76]	[Exit TYRREL]
[02:35.84]	The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
[02:40.08]	His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
[02:44.86]	The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
[02:49.37]	And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
[02:54.15]	Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
[02:58.30]	At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
[03:02.53]	And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
[03:07.22]	To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
[03:10.92]	[Enter CATESBY]
[03:12.00]CATESBY	My lord!
[03:13.27]KING RICHARD III	Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
[03:18.14]CATESBY	Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
[03:22.38]	And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
[03:27.07]	Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
[03:31.85]KING RICHARD III	Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
[03:35.99]	Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
[03:40.23]	Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
[03:44.56]	Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
[03:48.08]	Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
[03:52.68]	Then fiery expedition be my wing,
[03:56.20]	Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
[04:00.07]	Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
[04:04.22]	We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
[04:09.00]	[Exeunt]
