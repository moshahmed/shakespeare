[00:00.31]	[Lord Derby's house.,]
[00:00.94]	[Enter DERBY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK]
[00:01.57]DERBY	Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
[00:04.14]	That in the sty of this most bloody boar
[00:06.61]	My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
[00:09.23]	If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
[00:11.69]	The fear of that withholds my present aid.
[00:14.21]	But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
[00:16.78]CHRISTOPHER	At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
[00:19.20]DERBY	What men of name resort to him?
[00:21.14]CHRISTOPHER	Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
[00:23.45]	Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
[00:25.81]	Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
[00:28.32]	And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
[00:30.69]	And many more of noble fame and worth:
[00:32.99]	And towards London they do bend their course,
[00:35.67]	If by the way they be not fought withal.
[00:38.08]DERBY	Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
[00:40.44]	Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
[00:43.01]	He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
[00:45.43]	These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.
[00:48.42]	[Exeunt]
