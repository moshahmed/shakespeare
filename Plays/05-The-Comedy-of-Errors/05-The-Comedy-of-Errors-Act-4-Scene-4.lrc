[00:00.33]	[A street.,]
[00:01.00]	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer]
[00:01.66]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
[00:04.11]	I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
[00:07.00]	To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
[00:09.28]	My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
[00:11.61]	And will not lightly trust the messenger
[00:14.23]	That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
[00:16.62]	I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
[00:19.34]	[Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end]
[00:20.01]	Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
[00:22.90]	How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?
[00:25.51]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
[00:28.29]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	But where's the money?
[00:29.85]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
[00:32.29]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
[00:34.80]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
[00:37.58]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
[00:40.19]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.
[00:43.30]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
[00:45.80]	[Beating him]
[00:46.47]Officer	Good sir, be patient.
[00:47.92]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.
[00:50.86]Officer	Good, now, hold thy tongue.
[00:52.59]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
[00:55.25]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
[00:57.37]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
[01:00.54]	your blows.
[01:01.48]ANTIPHOLUS	Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
[01:04.71]	ass.
[01:05.26]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
[01:08.21]	ears. I have served him from the hour of my
[01:10.93]	nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
[01:13.99]	hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
[01:17.05]	heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
[01:20.10]	with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
[01:22.94]	raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
[01:26.11]	it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
[01:29.22]	I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
[01:32.00]	beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
[01:34.89]	lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
[01:37.84]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
[01:40.34]	[Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH]
[01:41.01]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
[01:43.73]	rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
[01:46.68]	rope's-end.'
[01:47.62]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Wilt thou still talk?
[01:49.12]	[Beating him]
[01:49.79]Courtezan	How say you now? is not your husband mad?
[01:52.35]ADRIANA	His incivility confirms no less.
[01:54.46]	Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
[01:56.85]	Establish him in his true sense again,
[01:59.30]	And I will please you what you will demand.
[02:02.02]LUCIANA	Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
[02:04.47]Courtezan	Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
[02:06.80]PINCH	Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
[02:09.64]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
[02:12.31]	[Striking him]
[02:12.97]PINCH	I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
[02:15.70]	To yield possession to my holy prayers
[02:18.20]	And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
[02:21.15]	I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
[02:23.87]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
[02:26.37]ADRIANA	O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
[02:29.04]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	You minion, you, are these your customers?
[02:31.60]	Did this companion with the saffron face
[02:34.21]	Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
[02:36.66]	Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
[02:39.32]	And I denied to enter in my house?
[02:41.55]ADRIANA	O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
[02:44.22]	Where would you had remain'd until this time,
[02:47.05]	Free from these slanders and this open shame!
[02:49.89]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
[02:52.67]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
[02:55.33]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
[02:58.06]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
[03:01.01]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	And did not she herself revile me there?
[03:03.56]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
[03:06.18]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
[03:09.23]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
[03:12.12]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	And did not I in rage depart from thence?
[03:14.74]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
[03:17.29]	That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
[03:20.07]ADRIANA	Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
[03:22.85]PINCH	It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
[03:25.47]	And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
[03:28.25]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
[03:31.14]ADRIANA	Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
[03:33.47]	By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
[03:36.03]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
[03:38.64]	But surely master, not a rag of money.
[03:41.03]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
[03:43.92]ADRIANA	He came to me and I deliver'd it.
[03:46.09]LUCIANA	And I am witness with her that she did.
[03:48.59]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	God and the rope-maker bear me witness
[03:51.09]	That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
[03:53.60]PINCH	Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
[03:56.26]	I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
[03:58.88]	They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
[04:01.77]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
[04:04.66]	And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
[04:07.16]ADRIANA	I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
[04:09.77]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	And, gentle master, I received no gold;
[04:12.16]	But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
[04:14.83]ADRIANA	Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
[04:17.83]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
[04:20.45]	And art confederate with a damned pack
[04:22.95]	To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
[04:25.45]	But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
[04:28.73]	That would behold in me this shameful sport.
[04:31.51]	[Enter three or four, and offer to bind him.
[04:31.84]	+ He strives]
[04:32.18]ADRIANA	O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.
[04:35.01]PINCH	More company! The fiend is strong within him.
[04:37.79]LUCIANA	Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
[04:40.41]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
[04:43.02]	I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
[04:45.58]	To make a rescue?
[04:46.85]	Officer Masters, let him go
[04:48.69]	He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
[04:51.52]PINCH	Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
[04:54.03]	[They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus]
[04:54.69]ADRIANA	What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
[04:57.19]	Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
[04:59.75]	Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
[05:02.20]Officer	He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
[05:04.42]	The debt he owes will be required of me.
[05:06.98]ADRIANA	I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
[05:09.59]	Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
[05:11.93]	And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
[05:14.76]	Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
[05:17.37]	Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
[05:19.71]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	O most unhappy strumpet!
[05:21.38]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
[05:23.99]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?
[05:26.94]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
[05:29.99]	cry 'The devil!'
[05:31.11]LUCIANA	God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
[05:33.77]ADRIANA	Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
[05:36.33]	[Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and
[05:36.67]	+ Courtezan]
[05:37.00]	Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
[05:39.39]Officer	One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?
[05:41.89]ADRIANA	I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
[05:44.39]Officer	Two hundred ducats.
[05:45.78]ADRIANA	Say, how grows it due?
[05:47.28]Officer	Due for a chain your husband had of him.
[05:49.84]ADRIANA	He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
[05:52.68]Courtezan	When as your husband all in rage to-day
[05:55.23]	Came to my house and took away my ring--
[05:57.74]	The ring I saw upon his finger now--
[06:00.01]	Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
[06:02.74]ADRIANA	It may be so, but I did never see it.
[06:05.07]	Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
[06:07.85]	I long to know the truth hereof at large.
[06:10.47]	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn,
[06:10.80]	+ and DROMIO of Syracuse]
[06:11.13]LUCIANA	God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
[06:13.63]ADRIANA	And come with naked swords.
[06:15.47]	Let's call more help to have them bound again.
[06:18.36]Officer	Away! they'll kill us.
[06:19.86]	[Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio
[06:20.19]	+ of Syracuse]
[06:20.53]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	I see these witches are afraid of swords.
[06:23.14]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	She that would be your wife now ran from you.
[06:25.98]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
[06:28.98]	I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
[06:31.65]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
[06:34.76]	no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
[06:37.76]	methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
[06:40.99]	the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
[06:44.10]	me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
[06:47.27]	turn witch.
[06:48.21]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	I will not stay to-night for all the town;
[06:50.88]	Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
[06:53.38]	[Exeunt]
