[00:00.34]	[A public place.,]
[00:01.02]	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse]
[00:01.71]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
[00:04.16]	Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
[00:06.90]	Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
[00:09.59]	By computation and mine host's report.
[00:12.10]	I could not speak with Dromio since at first
[00:15.01]	I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
[00:17.81]	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]
[00:18.49]	How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
[00:21.17]	As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
[00:23.91]	You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
[00:26.60]	Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
[00:29.51]	My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
[00:32.25]	That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
[00:34.87]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
[00:37.56]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
[00:40.30]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I did not see you since you sent me hence,
[00:43.04]	Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
[00:46.00]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
[00:48.80]	And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
[00:51.54]	For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.
[00:54.57]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
[00:57.19]	What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
[01:00.22]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
[01:03.13]	Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
[01:06.33]	[Beating him]
[01:07.01]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
[01:10.15]	Upon what bargain do you give it me?
[01:12.55]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Because that I familiarly sometimes
[01:14.95]	Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
[01:17.63]	Your sauciness will jest upon my love
[01:20.14]	And make a common of my serious hours.
[01:22.65]	When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
[01:25.79]	But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
[01:28.76]	If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
[01:31.39]	And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
[01:33.90]	Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
[01:36.64]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
[01:39.83]	had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
[01:42.97]	long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
[01:46.17]	it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
[01:49.42]	But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
[01:51.54]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Dost thou not know?
[01:52.96]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
[01:55.19]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Shall I tell you why?
[01:56.73]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
[01:59.87]	a wherefore.
[02:00.90]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
[02:03.81]	For urging it the second time to me.
[02:06.21]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
[02:09.35]	When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
[02:12.60]	nor reason?
[02:13.57]	Well, sir, I thank you.
[02:15.11]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Thank me, sir, for what?
[02:16.71]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
[02:20.36]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
[02:23.56]	something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
[02:26.19]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
[02:28.93]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	In good time, sir; what's that?
[02:30.92]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Basting.
[02:31.72]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
[02:33.61]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
[02:36.18]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Your reason?
[02:37.20]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
[02:40.40]	dry basting.
[02:41.43]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
[02:44.40]	time for all things.
[02:45.88]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
[02:49.25]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	By what rule, sir?
[02:50.56]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
[02:53.59]	pate of father Time himself.
[02:55.53]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Let's hear it.
[02:56.67]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
[02:59.92]	grows bald by nature.
[03:01.46]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	May he not do it by fine and recovery?
[03:03.97]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
[03:07.06]	lost hair of another man.
[03:08.83]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
[03:12.02]	so plentiful an excrement?
[03:13.85]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
[03:17.10]	and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
[03:21.04]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
[03:24.30]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
[03:27.84]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
[03:31.60]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
[03:34.74]	it in a kind of jollity.
[03:36.46]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	For what reason?
[03:37.71]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	For two; and sound ones too.
[03:39.59]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Nay, not sound, I pray you.
[03:41.36]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Sure ones, then.
[03:42.56]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
[03:44.73]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Certain ones then.
[03:46.10]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Name them.
[03:47.02]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	The one, to save the money that he spends in
[03:49.87]	trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
[03:53.07]	drop in his porridge.
[03:54.61]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	You would all this time have proved there is no
[03:57.69]	time for all things.
[03:59.17]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
[04:02.31]	lost by nature.
[04:03.51]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
[04:06.82]	time to recover.
[04:08.08]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
[04:11.28]	to the world's end will have bald followers.
[04:14.13]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
[04:16.47]	But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
[04:18.47]	[Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA]
[04:19.15]ADRIANA	Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
[04:21.78]	Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
[04:24.58]	I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
[04:26.63]	The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
[04:29.71]	That never words were music to thine ear,
[04:32.40]	That never object pleasing in thine eye,
[04:35.02]	That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
[04:37.76]	That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
[04:40.56]	Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
[04:43.98]	How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
[04:46.78]	That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
[04:49.52]	Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
[04:52.03]	That, undividable, incorporate,
[04:54.03]	Am better than thy dear self's better part.
[04:56.83]	Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
[04:59.23]	For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
[05:01.97]	A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
[05:04.42]	And take unmingled that same drop again,
[05:07.05]	Without addition or diminishing,
[05:09.22]	As take from me thyself and not me too.
[05:11.78]	How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
[05:14.52]	Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
[05:17.21]	And that this body, consecrate to thee,
[05:19.72]	By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
[05:22.23]	Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
[05:25.08]	And hurl the name of husband in my face
[05:27.71]	And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
[05:30.62]	And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
[05:33.48]	And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
[05:36.04]	I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
[05:39.07]	I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
[05:41.64]	My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
[05:44.44]	For if we too be one and thou play false,
[05:47.12]	I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
[05:49.52]	Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
[05:51.80]	Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
[05:54.94]	I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
[05:57.34]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
[06:00.02]	In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
[06:02.30]	As strange unto your town as to your talk;
[06:05.04]	Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
[06:07.84]	Want wit in all one word to understand.
[06:10.41]LUCIANA	Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
[06:13.38]	When were you wont to use my sister thus?
[06:16.06]	She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
[06:18.80]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	By Dromio?
[06:19.71]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	By me?
[06:20.40]ADRIANA	By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
[06:23.25]	That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
[06:25.94]	Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
[06:28.56]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
[06:31.36]	What is the course and drift of your compact?
[06:34.27]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
[06:36.72]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
[06:39.52]	Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
[06:41.98]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I never spake with her in all my life.
[06:44.49]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	How can she thus then call us by our names,
[06:47.28]	Unless it be by inspiration.
[06:49.23]ADRIANA	How ill agrees it with your gravity
[06:51.62]	To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
[06:54.48]	Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
[06:56.93]	Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
[06:59.44]	But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
[07:02.41]	Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
[07:05.21]	Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
[07:07.61]	Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
[07:10.52]	Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
[07:13.26]	If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
[07:16.00]	Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
[07:18.17]	Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
[07:20.96]	Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
[07:23.65]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
[07:26.50]	What, was I married to her in my dream?
[07:29.01]	Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
[07:31.70]	What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
[07:34.44]	Until I know this sure uncertainty,
[07:36.78]	I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
[07:39.12]LUCIANA	Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
[07:42.03]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
[07:44.60]	This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
[07:47.28]	We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
[07:49.79]	If we obey them not, this will ensue,
[07:52.19]	They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
[07:55.44]LUCIANA	Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
[07:58.41]	Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
[08:01.49]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I am transformed, master, am I not?
[08:03.72]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
[08:06.17]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
[08:08.80]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Thou hast thine own form.
[08:10.57]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, I am an ape.
[08:11.77]LUCIANA	If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
[08:14.57]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
[08:17.36]	'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
[08:20.10]	But I should know her as well as she knows me.
[08:23.07]ADRIANA	Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
[08:25.53]	To put the finger in the eye and weep,
[08:28.04]	Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
[08:30.95]	Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
[08:33.57]	Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
[08:36.20]	And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
[08:38.88]	Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
[08:41.39]	Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
[08:44.31]	Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
[08:46.93]ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE	Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
[08:49.27]	Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
[08:51.84]	Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
[08:54.52]	I'll say as they say and persever so,
[08:56.98]	And in this mist at all adventures go.
[08:59.49]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
[09:01.94]ADRIANA	Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
[09:04.86]LUCIANA	Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
[09:07.37]	[Exeunt]
