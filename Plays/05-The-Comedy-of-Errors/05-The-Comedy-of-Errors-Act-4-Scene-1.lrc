[00:00.35]	[A public place.,]
[00:01.06]	[Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer]
[00:01.78]Second Merchant	You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
[00:04.50]	And since I have not much importuned you;
[00:07.29]	Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
[00:09.90]	To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
[00:12.75]	Therefore make present satisfaction,
[00:15.24]	Or I'll attach you by this officer.
[00:17.68]ANGELO	Even just the sum that I do owe to you
[00:20.35]	Is growing to me by Antipholus,
[00:22.54]	And in the instant that I met with you
[00:25.21]	He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
[00:27.77]	I shall receive the money for the same.
[00:30.44]	Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
[00:33.40]	I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
[00:36.31]	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus
[00:36.67]	+ from the courtezan's]
[00:37.02]Officer	That labour may you save: see where he comes.
[00:39.99]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
[00:42.96]	And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
[00:45.69]	Among my wife and her confederates,
[00:48.12]	For locking me out of my doors by day.
[00:50.73]	But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
[00:53.64]	Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.
[00:56.37]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.
[00:59.27]	[Exit]
[00:59.99]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
[01:02.77]	I promised your presence and the chain;
[01:05.44]	But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
[01:08.35]	Belike you thought our love would last too long,
[01:11.56]	If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
[01:14.94]ANGELO	Saving your merry humour, here's the note
[01:17.73]	How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
[01:20.87]	The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
[01:24.02]	Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
[01:26.92]	Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
[01:29.54]	I pray you, see him presently discharged,
[01:32.27]	For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
[01:35.23]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	I am not furnish'd with the present money;
[01:38.08]	Besides, I have some business in the town.
[01:40.87]	Good signior, take the stranger to my house
[01:43.78]	And with you take the chain and bid my wife
[01:46.74]	Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
[01:49.47]	Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
[01:52.26]ANGELO	Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
[01:55.35]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
[01:58.55]ANGELO	Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
[02:01.58]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
[02:04.13]	Or else you may return without your money.
[02:06.98]ANGELO	Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
[02:09.83]	Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
[02:12.79]	And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
[02:15.70]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
[02:18.61]	Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
[02:21.40]	I should have chid you for not bringing it,
[02:24.30]	But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
[02:27.15]Second Merchant	The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
[02:30.06]ANGELO	You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!
[02:32.79]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.
[02:35.76]ANGELO	Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
[02:38.60]	Either send the chain or send me by some token.
[02:41.75]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
[02:44.60]	where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
[02:47.51]Second Merchant	My business cannot brook this dalliance.
[02:50.24]	Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
[02:53.20]	If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
[02:55.75]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	I answer you! what should I answer you?
[02:58.36]ANGELO	The money that you owe me for the chain.
[03:01.09]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	I owe you none till I receive the chain.
[03:03.82]ANGELO	You know I gave it you half an hour since.
[03:06.67]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
[03:09.70]ANGELO	You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
[03:12.19]	Consider how it stands upon my credit.
[03:14.80]Second Merchant	Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
[03:17.23]Officer	I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.
[03:20.56]ANGELO	This touches me in reputation.
[03:22.69]	Either consent to pay this sum for me
[03:25.30]	Or I attach you by this officer.
[03:27.56]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Consent to pay thee that I never had!
[03:30.11]	Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.
[03:32.84]ANGELO	Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
[03:35.27]	I would not spare my brother in this case,
[03:38.12]	If he should scorn me so apparently.
[03:40.61]Officer	I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
[03:43.22]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
[03:45.78]	But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
[03:48.74]	As all the metal in your shop will answer.
[03:51.59]ANGELO	Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
[03:54.02]	To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.
[03:56.69]	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay]
[03:57.41]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
[03:59.90]	That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
[04:02.81]	And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
[04:05.95]	I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
[04:08.74]	The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
[04:11.23]	The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
[04:13.90]	Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
[04:17.17]	But for their owner, master, and yourself.
[04:19.89]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
[04:22.62]	What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
[04:25.12]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
[04:27.73]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
[04:30.58]	And told thee to what purpose and what end.
[04:33.48]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
[04:36.03]	You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
[04:38.65]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	I will debate this matter at more leisure
[04:41.49]	And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
[04:44.58]	To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
[04:47.13]	Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
[04:50.04]	That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
[04:52.89]	There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
[04:55.79]	Tell her I am arrested in the street
[04:58.35]	And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
[05:01.43]	On, officer, to prison till it come.
[05:03.80]	[Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and
[05:04.16]	+ Antipholus of Ephesus]
[05:04.52]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	To Adriana! that is where we dined,
[05:06.89]	Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
[05:09.86]	She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
[05:12.59]	Thither I must, although against my will,
[05:15.32]	For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.
[05:18.34]	[Exit]
