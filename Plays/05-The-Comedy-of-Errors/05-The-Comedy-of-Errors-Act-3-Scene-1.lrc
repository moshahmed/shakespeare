[00:00.31]	[Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.,]
[00:00.95]	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus,
[00:01.26]	+ ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR]
[00:01.58]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
[00:04.17]	My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
[00:06.70]	Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
[00:09.23]	To see the making of her carcanet,
[00:11.34]	And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
[00:13.88]	But here's a villain that would face me down
[00:16.57]	He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
[00:19.10]	And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
[00:21.85]	And that I did deny my wife and house.
[00:24.17]	Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
[00:27.02]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
[00:29.71]	That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
[00:32.88]	If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
[00:36.31]	Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
[00:39.21]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	I think thou art an ass.
[00:40.80]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Marry, so it doth appear
[00:42.38]	By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
[00:45.02]	I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
[00:47.98]	You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
[00:50.93]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
[00:53.78]	May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
[00:56.79]BALTHAZAR	I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
[00:59.22]	welcome dear.
[01:00.22]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
[01:02.86]	A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.
[01:05.92]BALTHAZAR	Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
[01:08.83]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.
[01:11.94]BALTHAZAR	Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
[01:14.90]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
[01:17.64]	But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
[01:20.65]	Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
[01:23.71]	But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.
[01:26.62]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!
[01:28.99]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
[01:31.21]	idiot, patch!
[01:32.16]	Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
[01:35.38]	Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st
[01:38.23]	for such store,
[01:39.34]	When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.
[01:42.35]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
[01:45.25]	the street.
[01:46.15]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
[01:48.94]	catch cold on's feet.
[01:50.37]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Who talks within there? ho, open the door!
[01:52.80]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell
[01:55.59]	me wherefore.
[01:56.60]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.
[01:59.45]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again
[02:02.19]	when you may.
[02:03.20]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?
[02:06.42]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name
[02:09.21]	is Dromio.
[02:10.06]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
[02:13.33]	The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
[02:16.34]	If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
[02:19.03]	Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
[02:22.15]	name for an ass.
[02:23.31]LUCE	[Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
[02:26.16]	at the gate?
[02:27.11]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Let my master in, Luce.
[02:28.58]LUCE	[Within] Faith, no; he comes too late;
[02:30.64]	And so tell your master.
[02:32.23]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	O Lord, I must laugh!
[02:33.60]	Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?
[02:36.61]LUCE	[Within] Have at you with another; that's--When?
[02:39.19]	can you tell?
[02:40.20]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
[02:43.05]	answered him well.
[02:44.31]ANTIPHOLUS	Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
[02:47.11]OF EPHESUS
[02:47.69]LUCE	[Within] I thought to have asked you.
[02:49.80]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] And you said no.
[02:51.28]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
[02:54.19]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Thou baggage, let me in.
[02:55.72]LUCE	[Within] Can you tell for whose sake?
[02:57.83]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Master, knock the door hard.
[02:59.57]LUCE	[Within] Let him knock till it ache.
[03:01.63]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
[03:04.64]LUCE	[Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
[03:08.07]ADRIANA	[Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all
[03:10.76]	this noise?
[03:11.66]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with
[03:14.35]	unruly boys.
[03:15.30]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
[03:18.04]ADRIANA	[Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.
[03:21.05]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
[03:24.11]ANGELO	Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
[03:26.91]	fain have either.
[03:28.13]BALTHAZAR	In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
[03:31.29]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
[03:34.46]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
[03:37.58]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
[03:40.58]	Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
[03:43.96]	It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
[03:47.39]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
[03:50.14]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your
[03:53.09]	knave's pate.
[03:54.10]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
[03:57.53]	Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
[04:00.75]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
[04:03.49]	thee, hind!
[04:04.34]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
[04:06.87]	let me in.
[04:07.72]DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
[04:11.09]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.
[04:13.47]DROMIO OF EPHESUS	A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
[04:16.00]	For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
[04:19.38]	If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
[04:22.65]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
[04:25.03]BALTHAZAR	Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
[04:27.30]	Herein you war against your reputation
[04:29.67]	And draw within the compass of suspect
[04:32.05]	The unviolated honour of your wife.
[04:34.21]	Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
[04:36.91]	Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
[04:39.07]	Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
[04:41.71]	And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
[04:44.30]	Why at this time the doors are made against you.
[04:47.15]	Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
[04:49.26]	And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
[04:51.58]	And about evening come yourself alone
[04:53.90]	To know the reason of this strange restraint.
[04:56.59]	If by strong hand you offer to break in
[04:59.02]	Now in the stirring passage of the day,
[05:01.40]	A vulgar comment will be made of it,
[05:03.61]	And that supposed by the common rout
[05:05.88]	Against your yet ungalled estimation
[05:08.15]	That may with foul intrusion enter in
[05:10.48]	And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
[05:13.12]	For slander lives upon succession,
[05:15.23]	For ever housed where it gets possession.
[05:17.71]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
[05:20.24]	And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
[05:22.72]	I know a wench of excellent discourse,
[05:25.05]	Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
[05:27.53]	There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
[05:30.06]	My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
[05:32.33]	Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
[05:34.55]	To her will we to dinner.
[05:36.18]	[To Angelo]
[05:36.82]	Get you home
[05:37.82]	And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
[05:40.46]	Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
[05:42.78]	For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
[05:45.58]	Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
[05:47.95]	Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
[05:50.59]	Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
[05:53.23]	I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
[05:56.19]ANGELO	I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
[05:58.83]ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS	Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
[06:01.41]	[Exeunt]
