[00:00.39]	[Venice. A court of justice.,]
[00:01.18]	[Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO,
[00:01.57]	+ GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others]
[00:01.97]DUKE	What, is Antonio here?
[00:03.74]ANTONIO	Ready, so please your grace.
[00:05.91]DUKE	I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
[00:09.20]	A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
[00:11.96]	uncapable of pity, void and empty
[00:14.52]	From any dram of mercy.
[00:16.43]ANTONIO	I have heard
[00:17.68]	Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
[00:21.03]	His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
[00:24.64]	And that no lawful means can carry me
[00:27.54]	Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
[00:30.30]	My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
[00:33.12]	To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
[00:35.95]	The very tyranny and rage of his.
[00:38.51]DUKE	Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
[00:41.47]SALERIO	He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
[00:44.56]	[Enter SHYLOCK]
[00:45.35]DUKE	Make room, and let him stand before our face.
[00:48.64]	Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
[00:51.92]	That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
[00:55.54]	To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
[00:58.89]	Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
[01:02.44]	Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
[01:05.27]	And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
[01:08.29]	Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
[01:11.77]	Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
[01:14.80]	But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
[01:18.02]	Forgive a moiety of the principal;
[01:20.65]	Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
[01:23.54]	That have of late so huddled on his back,
[01:26.63]	Enow to press a royal merchant down
[01:29.39]	And pluck commiseration of his state
[01:32.22]	From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
[01:35.57]	From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
[01:38.99]	To offices of tender courtesy.
[01:41.35]	We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
[01:43.98]SHYLOCK	I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
[01:47.40]	And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
[01:50.23]	To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
[01:53.18]	If you deny it, let the danger light
[01:55.94]	Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
[01:59.10]	You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
[02:02.25]	A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
[02:05.41]	Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
[02:08.63]	But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
[02:11.59]	What if my house be troubled with a rat
[02:14.61]	And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
[02:17.96]	To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
[02:21.18]	Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
[02:24.27]	Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
[02:27.23]	And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
[02:30.58]	Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
[02:33.67]	Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
[02:36.76]	Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
[02:40.31]	As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
[02:43.47]	Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
[02:46.03]	Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
[02:48.53]	Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
[02:51.42]	Must yield to such inevitable shame
[02:54.18]	As to offend, himself being offended;
[02:56.94]	So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
[02:59.90]	More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
[03:03.38]	I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
[03:06.01]	A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
[03:09.23]BASSANIO	This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
[03:12.06]	To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
[03:14.89]SHYLOCK	I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
[03:18.30]BASSANIO	Do all men kill the things they do not love?
[03:21.59]SHYLOCK	Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
[03:24.75]BASSANIO	Every offence is not a hate at first.
[03:27.57]SHYLOCK	What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
[03:31.25]ANTONIO	I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
[03:34.47]	You may as well go stand upon the beach
[03:37.50]	And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
[03:40.85]	You may as well use question with the wolf
[03:44.07]	Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
[03:47.36]	You may as well forbid the mountain pines
[03:50.51]	To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
[03:53.80]	When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
[03:57.28]	You may as well do anything most hard,
[04:00.18]	As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
[04:03.72]	His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
[04:07.01]	Make no more offers, use no farther means,
[04:10.10]	But with all brief and plain conveniency
[04:13.19]	Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
[04:16.34]BASSANIO	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
[04:19.50]SHYLOCK	What judgment shall I dread, doing
[04:22.13]	Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
[04:25.22]	I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
[04:28.44]DUKE	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
[04:31.79]SHYLOCK	What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
[04:35.01]	You have among you many a purchased slave,
[04:38.17]	Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
[04:41.59]	You use in abject and in slavish parts,
[04:44.54]	Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
[04:47.76]	Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
[04:50.92]	Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
[04:54.27]	Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
[04:57.76]	Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
[05:01.11]	'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
[05:04.07]	The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
[05:07.15]	Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
[05:10.51]	If you deny me, fie upon your law!
[05:13.07]	There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
[05:16.29]	I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
[05:19.58]DUKE	Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
[05:22.54]	Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
[05:25.10]	Whom I have sent for to determine this,
[05:28.06]	Come here to-day.
[05:29.57]SALERIO	My lord, here stays without
[05:31.74]	A messenger with letters from the doctor,
[05:34.83]	New come from Padua.
[05:36.54]DUKE	Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
[05:39.49]BASSANIO	Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
[05:42.52]	The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
[05:46.07]	Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
[05:49.42]ANTONIO	I am a tainted wether of the flock,
[05:52.11]	Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
[05:55.40]	Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
[05:58.62]	You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
[06:01.58]	Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
[06:04.73]	[Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk]
[06:05.52]DUKE	Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
[06:08.15]NERISSA	From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
[06:11.51]	[Presenting a letter]
[06:12.29]BASSANIO	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
[06:15.45]SHYLOCK	To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
[06:18.93]GRATIANO	Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
[06:22.09]	Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
[06:25.37]	No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
[06:28.92]	Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
[06:32.28]SHYLOCK	No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
[06:35.43]GRATIANO	O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
[06:37.99]	And for thy life let justice be accused.
[06:41.02]	Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
[06:44.04]	To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
[06:46.54]	That souls of animals infuse themselves
[06:49.56]	Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
[06:52.72]	Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
[06:56.20]	Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
[06:59.62]	And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
[07:02.97]	Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
[07:05.93]	Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.
[07:08.95]SHYLOCK	Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
[07:12.44]	Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
[07:15.86]	Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
[07:19.01]	To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
[07:21.90]DUKE	This letter from Bellario doth commend
[07:24.86]	A young and learned doctor to our court.
[07:27.88]	Where is he?
[07:29.07]NERISSA	He attendeth here hard by,
[07:31.17]	To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
[07:34.52]DUKE	With all my heart. Some three or four of you
[07:37.81]	Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
[07:41.10]	Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
[07:44.65]Clerk	[Reads]
[07:45.43]	Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
[07:49.18]	your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
[07:52.93]	your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
[07:56.61]	me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
[08:00.29]	acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
[08:04.17]	the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
[08:07.72]	many books together: he is furnished with my
[08:11.00]	opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
[08:14.62]	greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
[08:18.17]	with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
[08:21.92]	request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
[08:25.60]	years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
[08:29.28]	estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
[08:33.09]	old a head. I leave him to your gracious
[08:36.11]	acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
[08:39.66]	commendation.
[08:40.91]DUKE	You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
[08:44.26]	And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
[08:47.16]	[Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws]
[08:47.94]	Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
[08:51.30]PORTIA	I did, my lord.
[08:52.61]DUKE	You are welcome: take your place.
[08:55.11]	Are you acquainted with the difference
[08:58.07]	That holds this present question in the court?
[09:01.48]PORTIA	I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
[09:04.38]	Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
[09:07.73]DUKE	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
[09:10.82]PORTIA	Is your name Shylock?
[09:12.59]SHYLOCK	Shylock is my name.
[09:14.24]PORTIA	Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
[09:17.46]	Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
[09:20.42]	Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
[09:23.18]	You stand within his danger, do you not?
[09:26.13]ANTONIO	Ay, so he says.
[09:27.45]PORTIA	Do you confess the bond?
[09:29.42]ANTONIO	I do.
[09:30.14]PORTIA	Then must the Jew be merciful.
[09:32.51]SHYLOCK	On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
[09:35.47]PORTIA	The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
[09:38.29]	It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
[09:41.51]	Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
[09:44.60]	It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
[09:48.02]	'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
[09:51.18]	The throned monarch better than his crown;
[09:54.33]	His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
[09:57.75]	The attribute to awe and majesty,
[10:00.31]	Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
[10:03.67]	But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
[10:06.56]	It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
[10:09.52]	It is an attribute to God himself;
[10:12.15]	And earthly power doth then show likest God's
[10:15.56]	When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
[10:18.65]	Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
[10:21.74]	That, in the course of justice, none of us
[10:24.83]	Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
[10:27.99]	And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
[10:31.60]	The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
[10:34.76]	To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
[10:37.52]	Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
[10:41.13]	Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
[10:44.88]SHYLOCK	My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
[10:47.77]	The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
[10:50.47]PORTIA	Is he not able to discharge the money?
[10:53.36]BASSANIO	Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
[10:56.51]	Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
[10:59.73]	I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
[11:02.82]	On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
[11:05.85]	If this will not suffice, it must appear
[11:08.87]	That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
[11:12.35]	Wrest once the law to your authority:
[11:15.18]	To do a great right, do a little wrong,
[11:18.07]	And curb this cruel devil of his will.
[11:20.97]PORTIA	It must not be; there is no power in Venice
[11:24.19]	Can alter a decree established:
[11:26.62]	'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
[11:29.25]	And many an error by the same example
[11:32.14]	Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
[11:35.03]SHYLOCK	A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
[11:37.99]	O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
[11:41.01]PORTIA	I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
[11:43.84]SHYLOCK	Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
[11:46.93]PORTIA	Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
[11:50.35]SHYLOCK	An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
[11:53.44]	Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
[11:56.00]	No, not for Venice.
[11:57.58]PORTIA	Why, this bond is forfeit;
[11:59.62]	And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
[12:02.57]	A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
[12:05.47]	Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
[12:08.55]	Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
[12:11.78]SHYLOCK	When it is paid according to the tenor.
[12:14.73]	It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
[12:17.63]	You know the law, your exposition
[12:20.19]	Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
[12:23.54]	Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
[12:26.56]	Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
[12:29.52]	There is no power in the tongue of man
[12:32.48]	To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
[12:35.18]ANTONIO	Most heartily I do beseech the court
[12:38.00]	To give the judgment.
[12:39.78]PORTIA	Why then, thus it is:
[12:41.49]	You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
[12:44.64]SHYLOCK	O noble judge! O excellent young man!
[12:47.40]PORTIA	For the intent and purpose of the law
[12:50.29]	Hath full relation to the penalty,
[12:52.92]	Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
[12:55.88]SHYLOCK	'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
[12:58.84]	How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
[13:02.13]PORTIA	Therefore lay bare your bosom.
[13:04.49]SHYLOCK	Ay, his breast:
[13:05.81]	So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
[13:08.90]	'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
[13:12.12]PORTIA	It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
[13:15.21]	The flesh?
[13:16.26]SHYLOCK	I have them ready.
[13:17.83]PORTIA	Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
[13:21.12]	To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
[13:24.47]SHYLOCK	Is it so nominated in the bond?
[13:26.91]PORTIA	It is not so express'd: but what of that?
[13:29.93]	'Twere good you do so much for charity.
[13:32.82]SHYLOCK	I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
[13:35.65]PORTIA	You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
[13:38.61]ANTONIO	But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
[13:41.63]	Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
[13:44.72]	Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
[13:48.01]	For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
[13:51.23]	Than is her custom: it is still her use
[13:54.18]	To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
[13:57.40]	To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
[14:00.56]	An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
[14:04.04]	Of such misery doth she cut me off.
[14:06.74]	Commend me to your honourable wife:
[14:09.43]	Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
[14:12.33]	Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
[14:15.55]	And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
[14:18.77]	Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
[14:21.59]	Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
[14:25.08]	And he repents not that he pays your debt;
[14:28.23]	For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
[14:31.12]	I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
[14:34.15]BASSANIO	Antonio, I am married to a wife
[14:36.58]	Which is as dear to me as life itself;
[14:39.47]	But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
[14:42.63]	Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
[14:45.65]	I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
[14:48.61]	Here to this devil, to deliver you.
[14:51.24]PORTIA	Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
[14:54.79]	If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
[14:57.94]GRATIANO	I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
[15:00.70]	I would she were in heaven, so she could
[15:03.73]	Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
[15:07.15]NERISSA	'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
[15:10.04]	The wish would make else an unquiet house.
[15:13.19]SHYLOCK	These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
[15:16.87]	Would any of the stock of Barrabas
[15:19.57]	Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
[15:22.92]	[Aside]
[15:23.71]	We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
[15:26.93]PORTIA	A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
[15:30.41]	The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
[15:33.77]SHYLOCK	Most rightful judge!
[15:35.48]PORTIA	And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
[15:39.02]	The law allows it, and the court awards it.
[15:42.18]SHYLOCK	Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
[15:45.40]PORTIA	Tarry a little; there is something else.
[15:48.36]	This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
[15:51.78]	The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
[15:54.87]	Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
[15:58.42]	But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
[16:01.44]	One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
[16:04.99]	Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
[16:07.81]	Unto the state of Venice.
[16:09.85]GRATIANO	O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
[16:12.94]SHYLOCK	Is that the law?
[16:14.39]PORTIA	Thyself shalt see the act:
[16:16.49]	For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
[16:19.38]	Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
[16:22.93]GRATIANO	O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
[16:26.02]SHYLOCK	I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
[16:29.24]	And let the Christian go.
[16:31.28]BASSANIO	Here is the money.
[16:32.86]PORTIA	Soft!
[16:33.58]	The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
[16:36.93]	He shall have nothing but the penalty.
[16:39.83]GRATIANO	O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
[16:42.78]PORTIA	Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
[16:46.07]	Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
[16:49.49]	But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
[16:52.91]	Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
[16:56.19]	As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
[16:59.48]	Or the division of the twentieth part
[17:02.37]	Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
[17:05.72]	But in the estimation of a hair,
[17:08.22]	Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
[17:11.51]GRATIANO	A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
[17:13.81]	Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
[17:16.44]PORTIA	Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
[17:19.66]SHYLOCK	Give me my principal, and let me go.
[17:22.35]BASSANIO	I have it ready for thee; here it is.
[17:25.11]PORTIA	He hath refused it in the open court:
[17:27.94]	He shall have merely justice and his bond.
[17:31.10]GRATIANO	A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
[17:33.92]	I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
[17:37.14]SHYLOCK	Shall I not have barely my principal?
[17:39.97]PORTIA	Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
[17:43.19]	To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
[17:45.69]SHYLOCK	Why, then the devil give him good of it!
[17:48.65]	I'll stay no longer question.
[17:50.95]PORTIA	Tarry, Jew:
[17:52.00]	The law hath yet another hold on you.
[17:54.82]	It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
[17:57.58]	If it be proved against an alien
[18:00.15]	That by direct or indirect attempts
[18:02.91]	He seek the life of any citizen,
[18:05.41]	The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
[18:08.69]	Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
[18:12.11]	Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
[18:15.07]	And the offender's life lies in the mercy
[18:18.22]	Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
[18:21.25]	In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
[18:24.34]	For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
[18:27.23]	That indirectly and directly too
[18:29.79]	Thou hast contrived against the very life
[18:32.95]	Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
[18:35.97]	The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
[18:38.73]	Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
[18:41.82]GRATIANO	Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
[18:45.31]	And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
[18:48.72]	Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
[18:51.68]	Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
[18:55.49]DUKE	That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
[18:59.17]	I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
[19:02.33]	For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
[19:05.09]	The other half comes to the general state,
[19:08.25]	Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
[19:11.20]PORTIA	Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
[19:13.77]SHYLOCK	Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
[19:16.86]	You take my house when you do take the prop
[19:20.14]	That doth sustain my house; you take my life
[19:23.43]	When you do take the means whereby I live.
[19:26.58]PORTIA	What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
[19:29.48]GRATIANO	A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.
[19:32.76]ANTONIO	So please my lord the duke and all the court
[19:36.12]	To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
[19:39.34]	I am content; so he will let me have
[19:42.10]	The other half in use, to render it,
[19:44.79]	Upon his death, unto the gentleman
[19:47.42]	That lately stole his daughter:
[19:49.85]	Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
[19:53.27]	He presently become a Christian;
[19:55.77]	The other, that he do record a gift,
[19:58.46]	Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
[20:01.68]	Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
[20:04.58]DUKE	He shall do this, or else I do recant
[20:07.40]	The pardon that I late pronounced here.
[20:10.36]PORTIA	Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
[20:13.52]SHYLOCK	I am content.
[20:14.77]PORTIA	Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
[20:16.87]SHYLOCK	I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
[20:20.02]	I am not well: send the deed after me,
[20:22.85]	And I will sign it.
[20:24.49]DUKE	Get thee gone, but do it.
[20:26.47]GRATIANO	In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
[20:29.95]	Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
[20:33.56]	To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
[20:36.72]	[Exit SHYLOCK]
[20:37.51]DUKE	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
[20:40.60]PORTIA	I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
[20:43.62]	I must away this night toward Padua,
[20:46.38]	And it is meet I presently set forth.
[20:49.21]DUKE	I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
[20:52.49]	Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
[20:54.93]	For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
[20:58.02]	[Exeunt Duke and his train]
[20:58.80]BASSANIO	Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
[21:01.70]	Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
[21:04.98]	Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
[21:07.88]	Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
[21:10.83]	We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
[21:14.05]ANTONIO	And stand indebted, over and above,
[21:16.68]	In love and service to you evermore.
[21:19.44]PORTIA	He is well paid that is well satisfied;
[21:22.40]	And I, delivering you, am satisfied
[21:25.03]	And therein do account myself well paid:
[21:28.05]	My mind was never yet more mercenary.
[21:30.88]	I pray you, know me when we meet again:
[21:33.77]	I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
[21:36.73]BASSANIO	Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
[21:40.08]	Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
[21:43.17]	Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
[21:46.46]	Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
[21:48.96]PORTIA	You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
[21:52.24]	[To ANTONIO]
[21:53.03]	Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
[21:56.65]	[To BASSANIO]
[21:57.44]	And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
[22:00.92]	Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
[22:04.27]	And you in love shall not deny me this.
[22:07.23]BASSANIO	This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
[22:10.19]	I will not shame myself to give you this.
[22:13.28]PORTIA	I will have nothing else but only this;
[22:16.24]	And now methinks I have a mind to it.
[22:19.06]BASSANIO	There's more depends on this than on the value.
[22:22.55]	The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
[22:25.77]	And find it out by proclamation:
[22:28.26]	Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
[22:30.96]PORTIA	I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
[22:33.72]	You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
[22:37.01]	You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
[22:40.36]BASSANIO	Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
[22:43.58]	And when she put it on, she made me vow
[22:46.54]	That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
[22:50.09]PORTIA	That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
[22:53.57]	An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
[22:56.27]	And know how well I have deserved the ring,
[22:59.49]	She would not hold out enemy for ever,
[23:02.38]	For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
[23:05.60]	[Exeunt Portia and Nerissa]
[23:06.39]ANTONIO	My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
[23:09.35]	Let his deservings and my love withal
[23:12.24]	Be valued against your wife's commandment.
[23:15.39]BASSANIO	Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
[23:17.96]	Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
[23:21.37]	Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
[23:24.20]	[Exit Gratiano]
[23:24.99]	Come, you and I will thither presently;
[23:27.88]	And in the morning early will we both
[23:30.77]	Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.
[23:33.27]	[Exeunt]
