[00:00.35]	[Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.,]
[00:01.05]	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]
[00:01.75]PORTIA	By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
[00:04.91]	this great world.
[00:06.25]NERISSA	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
[00:09.53]	the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
[00:12.74]	yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
[00:16.02]	with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
[00:19.29]	is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
[00:22.63]	mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
[00:25.84]	competency lives longer.
[00:27.60]PORTIA	Good sentences and well pronounced.
[00:30.00]NERISSA	They would be better, if well followed.
[00:32.57]PORTIA	If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
[00:35.90]	do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
[00:38.83]	cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
[00:42.10]	follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
[00:45.26]	twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
[00:48.65]	twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
[00:51.87]	devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
[00:55.09]	o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
[00:58.13]	youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
[01:01.40]	cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
[01:04.79]	choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
[01:07.89]	neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
[01:10.93]	dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
[01:14.27]	by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
[01:17.19]	Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
[01:20.41]NERISSA	Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
[01:23.80]	death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
[01:27.13]	that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
[01:30.47]	silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
[01:33.63]	chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
[01:36.84]	rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
[01:40.00]	warmth is there in your affection towards any of
[01:43.22]	these princely suitors that are already come?
[01:46.20]PORTIA	I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
[01:49.24]	them, I will describe them; and, according to my
[01:52.28]	description, level at my affection.
[01:54.62]NERISSA	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
[01:57.13]PORTIA	Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
[02:00.29]	talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
[02:03.10]	appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
[02:06.26]	shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
[02:09.30]	mother played false with a smith.
[02:11.58]NERISSA	Then there is the County Palatine.
[02:13.92]PORTIA	He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
[02:17.25]	will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
[02:20.47]	smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
[02:23.39]	philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
[02:26.49]	unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
[02:29.65]	married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
[02:32.98]	than to either of these. God defend me from these
[02:36.20]	two!
[02:36.79]NERISSA	How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
[02:39.89]PORTIA	God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
[02:43.16]	In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
[02:46.26]	he! why, he hath a horse better than the
[02:48.89]	Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
[02:52.11]	the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
[02:55.38]	throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
[02:58.72]	fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
[03:01.99]	should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
[03:05.38]	I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
[03:08.72]	shall never requite him.
[03:10.47]NERISSA	What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
[03:13.75]	of England?
[03:14.74]PORTIA	You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
[03:17.96]	not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
[03:21.00]	nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
[03:24.21]	swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
[03:27.55]	He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
[03:30.59]	converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
[03:33.81]	I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
[03:37.02]	hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
[03:40.01]	behavior every where.
[03:41.58]NERISSA	What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
[03:44.86]PORTIA	That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
[03:48.08]	borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
[03:51.23]	swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
[03:54.39]	think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
[03:57.61]	under for another.
[03:59.01]NERISSA	How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
[04:02.75]PORTIA	Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
[04:05.91]	most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
[04:09.25]	he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
[04:12.35]	when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
[04:15.62]	and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
[04:18.84]	make shift to go without him.
[04:20.88]NERISSA	If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
[04:24.16]	casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
[04:27.43]	will, if you should refuse to accept him.
[04:30.12]PORTIA	Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
[04:33.40]	deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
[04:36.67]	for if the devil be within and that temptation
[04:39.77]	without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
[04:42.87]	thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
[04:45.91]NERISSA	You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
[04:49.01]	lords: they have acquainted me with their
[04:51.76]	determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
[04:55.04]	home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
[04:58.25]	you may be won by some other sort than your father's
[05:01.70]	imposition depending on the caskets.
[05:04.16]PORTIA	If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
[05:07.32]	chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
[05:10.65]	of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
[05:14.04]	are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
[05:17.32]	but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
[05:20.71]	them a fair departure.
[05:22.35]NERISSA	Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
[05:25.57]	Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
[05:28.84]	in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
[05:31.53]PORTIA	Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.
[05:34.92]NERISSA	True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
[05:38.20]	eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
[05:41.59]PORTIA	I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
[05:44.81]	thy praise.
[05:45.80]	[Enter a Serving-man]
[05:46.50]	How now! what news?
[05:47.91]Servant	The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
[05:50.95]	their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
[05:54.22]	fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
[05:57.38]	prince his master will be here to-night.
[06:00.07]PORTIA	If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
[06:03.23]	heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
[06:06.62]	be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
[06:09.84]	of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
[06:12.94]	rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
[06:15.92]	Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
[06:17.73]	Whiles we shut the gates
[06:19.54]	upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
[06:22.35]	[Exeunt]
