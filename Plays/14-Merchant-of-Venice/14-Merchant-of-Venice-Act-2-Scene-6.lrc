[00:00.35]	[The same.,]
[00:01.05]	[Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued]
[00:01.75]GRATIANO	This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
[00:04.61]	Desired us to make stand.
[00:06.42]SALARINO	His hour is almost past.
[00:08.17]GRATIANO	And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
[00:10.86]	For lovers ever run before the clock.
[00:13.37]SALARINO	O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
[00:15.89]	To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
[00:19.10]	To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
[00:21.44]GRATIANO	That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
[00:24.12]	With that keen appetite that he sits down?
[00:26.93]	Where is the horse that doth untread again
[00:29.79]	His tedious measures with the unbated fire
[00:32.65]	That he did pace them first? All things that are,
[00:35.81]	Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
[00:38.55]	How like a younker or a prodigal
[00:40.83]	The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
[00:43.64]	Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
[00:46.38]	How like the prodigal doth she return,
[00:48.95]	With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
[00:51.76]	Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
[00:54.68]SALARINO	Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
[00:57.48]	[Enter LORENZO]
[00:58.18]LORENZO	Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
[01:01.22]	Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
[01:03.91]	When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
[01:07.30]	I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
[01:10.04]	Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
[01:12.85]	[Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes]
[01:13.55]JESSICA	Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
[01:16.18]	Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
[01:19.16]LORENZO	Lorenzo, and thy love.
[01:20.74]JESSICA	Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
[01:23.13]	For who love I so much? And now who knows
[01:25.88]	But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
[01:28.27]LORENZO	Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
[01:31.54]JESSICA	Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
[01:34.52]	I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
[01:37.33]	For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
[01:39.84]	But love is blind and lovers cannot see
[01:42.53]	The pretty follies that themselves commit;
[01:45.33]	For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
[01:48.25]	To see me thus transformed to a boy.
[01:50.71]LORENZO	Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
[01:53.34]JESSICA	What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
[01:55.97]	They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
[01:59.12]	Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
[02:01.57]	And I should be obscured.
[02:03.39]LORENZO	So are you, sweet,
[02:04.73]	Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
[02:07.18]	But come at once;
[02:08.53]	For the close night doth play the runaway,
[02:11.33]	And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
[02:14.14]JESSICA	I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
[02:17.00]	With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
[02:20.09]	[Exit above]
[02:20.80]GRATIANO	Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
[02:23.25]LORENZO	Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
[02:25.64]	For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
[02:28.22]	And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
[02:31.02]	And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
[02:33.88]	And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
[02:36.92]	Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
[02:39.61]	[Enter JESSICA, below]
[02:40.31]	What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
[02:42.82]	Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
[02:45.74]	[Exit with Jessica and Salarino]
[02:46.44]	[Enter ANTONIO]
[02:47.14]ANTONIO	Who's there?
[02:48.20]GRATIANO	Signior Antonio!
[02:49.48]ANTONIO	Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
[02:52.17]	'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
[02:55.21]	No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
[02:58.01]	Bassanio presently will go aboard:
[03:00.35]	I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
[03:02.98]GRATIANO	I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
[03:05.66]	Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
[03:08.35]	[Exeunt]
