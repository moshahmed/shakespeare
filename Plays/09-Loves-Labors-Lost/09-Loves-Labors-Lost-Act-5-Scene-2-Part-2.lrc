[00:00.44]PRINCESS	Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
[00:03.38]	[Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors]
[00:04.26]	Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
[00:07.86]BOYET	Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
[00:12.06]ROSALINE	Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
[00:15.95]PRINCESS	O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
[00:18.97]	Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
[00:22.94]	Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
[00:26.32]	This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
[00:30.07]ROSALINE	O, they were all in lamentable cases!
[00:33.16]	The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
[00:36.69]PRINCESS	Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
[00:40.07]MARIA	Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
[00:43.38]	No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
[00:47.21]KATHARINE	Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
[00:50.81]	And trow you what he called me?
[00:53.53]PRINCESS	Qualm, perhaps.
[00:55.00]KATHARINE	Yes, in good faith.
[00:56.77]PRINCESS	Go, sickness as thou art!
[00:58.97]ROSALINE	Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
[01:02.80]	But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
[01:06.48]PRINCESS	And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
[01:10.01]KATHARINE	And Longaville was for my service born.
[01:13.32]MARIA	Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
[01:16.62]BOYET	Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
[01:19.79]	Immediately they will again be here
[01:22.88]	In their own shapes; for it can never be
[01:26.26]	They will digest this harsh indignity.
[01:29.49]PRINCESS	Will they return?
[01:31.19]BOYET	They will, they will, God knows,
[01:33.83]	And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
[01:37.88]	Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
[01:41.70]	Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
[01:45.16]PRINCESS	How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
[01:48.61]BOYET	Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
[01:52.14]	Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
[01:55.97]	Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
[01:59.43]PRINCESS	Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
[02:02.44]	If they return in their own shapes to woo?
[02:05.97]ROSALINE	Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
[02:09.21]	Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
[02:13.25]	Let us complain to them what fools were here,
[02:17.00]	Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
[02:20.68]	And wonder what they were and to what end
[02:24.21]	Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
[02:28.11]	And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
[02:31.42]	Should be presented at our tent to us.
[02:34.65]BOYET	Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
[02:38.11]PRINCESS	Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
[02:41.49]	[Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA]
[02:42.37]	[Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN,
[02:42.81]	+ in their proper habits]
[02:43.26]FERDINAND	Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?
[02:46.86]BOYET	Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
[02:50.24]	Command me any service to her thither?
[02:53.48]FERDINAND	That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
[02:57.15]BOYET	I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
[03:00.39]	[Exit]
[03:01.27]BIRON	This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
[03:04.80]	And utters it again when God doth please:
[03:08.26]	He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
[03:11.72]	At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
[03:15.47]	And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
[03:19.22]	Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
[03:23.04]	This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
[03:26.72]	Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
[03:29.81]	A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
[03:33.19]	That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
[03:36.43]	This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
[03:39.96]	That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
[03:43.71]	In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
[03:46.79]	A mean most meanly; and in ushering
[03:49.81]	Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
[03:53.41]	The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
[03:57.24]	This is the flower that smiles on every one,
[04:00.91]	To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
[04:04.52]	And consciences, that will not die in debt,
[04:08.05]	Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.
[04:11.36]FERDINAND	A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
[04:15.03]	That put Armado's page out of his part!
[04:18.34]BIRON	See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
[04:21.95]	Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
[04:26.14]	[Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE,
[04:26.58]	+ MARIA, and KATHARINE]
[04:27.02]FERDINAND	All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
[04:30.55]PRINCESS	'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
[04:33.86]FERDINAND	Construe my speeches better, if you may.
[04:37.17]PRINCESS	Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
[04:40.70]FERDINAND	We came to visit you, and purpose now
[04:43.86]	To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
[04:47.47]PRINCESS	This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
[04:51.29]	Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
[04:54.60]FERDINAND	Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
[04:58.06]	The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
[05:01.59]PRINCESS	You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
[05:05.48]	For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
[05:09.23]	Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
[05:12.32]	As the unsullied lily, I protest,
[05:15.12]	A world of torments though I should endure,
[05:18.72]	I would not yield to be your house's guest;
[05:22.32]	So much I hate a breaking cause to be
[05:25.56]	Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.
[05:28.87]FERDINAND	O, you have lived in desolation here,
[05:31.96]	Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
[05:34.97]PRINCESS	Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
[05:38.06]	We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
[05:41.74]	A mess of Russians left us but of late.
[05:45.05]FERDINAND	How, madam! Russians!
[05:46.89]PRINCESS	Ay, in truth, my lord;
[05:48.80]	Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
[05:52.55]ROSALINE	Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
[05:55.78]	My lady, to the manner of the days,
[05:58.73]	In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
[06:01.89]	We four indeed confronted were with four
[06:05.35]	In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
[06:08.88]	And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
[06:12.41]	They did not bless us with one happy word.
[06:15.93]	I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
[06:19.61]	When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
[06:23.73]BIRON	This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
[06:27.19]	Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
[06:31.23]	With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
[06:34.69]	By light we lose light: your capacity
[06:37.85]	Is of that nature that to your huge store
[06:41.38]	Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
[06:45.50]ROSALINE	This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
[06:49.18]BIRON	I am a fool, and full of poverty.
[06:51.97]ROSALINE	But that you take what doth to you belong,
[06:55.50]	It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
[06:59.40]BIRON	O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
[07:02.49]ROSALINE	All the fool mine?
[07:04.25]BIRON	I cannot give you less.
[07:06.38]ROSALINE	Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
[07:09.91]BIRON	Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
[07:13.52]ROSALINE	There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
[07:17.27]	That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
[07:21.09]FERDINAND	We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
[07:24.92]DUMAIN	Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
[07:28.08]PRINCESS	Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
[07:31.68]ROSALINE	Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
[07:35.80]	Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
[07:38.96]BIRON	Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
[07:42.71]	Can any face of brass hold longer out?
[07:45.95]	Here stand I
[07:47.35]	lady, dart thy skill at me;
[07:49.70]	Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
[07:53.52]	Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
[07:57.49]	Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
[08:00.80]	And I will wish thee never more to dance,
[08:04.26]	Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
[08:07.42]	O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
[08:10.81]	Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
[08:14.34]	Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
[08:17.57]	Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
[08:21.25]	Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
[08:24.41]	Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
[08:27.94]	Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
[08:31.18]	Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
[08:34.63]	I do forswear them; and I here protest,
[08:37.87]	By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
[08:41.91]	Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
[08:45.66]	In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
[08:48.90]	And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
[08:52.06]	My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
[08:55.74]ROSALINE	Sans sans, I pray you.
[08:57.72]BIRON	Yet I have a trick
[08:59.56]	Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
[09:02.87]	I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
[09:06.33]	Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
[09:09.93]	They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
[09:13.46]	They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
[09:17.43]	These lords are visited; you are not free,
[09:20.89]	For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
[09:24.13]PRINCESS	No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
[09:27.95]BIRON	Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
[09:31.55]ROSALINE	It is not so; for how can this be true,
[09:34.79]	That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
[09:38.47]BIRON	Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
[09:41.92]ROSALINE	Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
[09:44.86]BIRON	Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
[09:48.32]FERDINAND	Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
[09:52.29]	Some fair excuse.
[09:53.98]PRINCESS	The fairest is confession.
[09:56.34]	Were not you here but even now disguised?
[09:59.79]FERDINAND	Madam, I was.
[10:01.12]PRINCESS	And were you well advised?
[10:03.47]FERDINAND	I was, fair madam.
[10:05.16]PRINCESS	When you then were here,
[10:07.37]	What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
[10:10.75]FERDINAND	That more than all the world I did respect her.
[10:14.65]PRINCESS	When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
[10:18.77]FERDINAND	Upon mine honour, no.
[10:20.68]PRINCESS	Peace, peace! forbear:
[10:22.59]	Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
[10:26.49]FERDINAND	Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
[10:30.02]PRINCESS	I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
[10:33.25]	What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
[10:36.71]ROSALINE	Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
[10:40.09]	As precious eyesight, and did value me
[10:43.33]	Above this world; adding thereto moreover
[10:46.79]	That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
[10:50.32]PRINCESS	God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
[10:53.70]	Most honourably doth unhold his word.
[10:56.86]FERDINAND	What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
[11:00.24]	I never swore this lady such an oath.
[11:03.41]ROSALINE	By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
[11:06.94]	You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
[11:10.24]FERDINAND	My faith and this the princess I did give:
[11:13.77]	I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
[11:17.08]PRINCESS	Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
[11:20.32]	And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
[11:23.56]	What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
[11:27.09]BIRON	Neither of either; I remit both twain.
[11:30.25]	I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
[11:33.63]	Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
[11:36.65]	To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
[11:39.66]	Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
[11:43.71]	Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
[11:47.68]	That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
[11:51.87]	To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
[11:55.40]	Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
[11:59.15]	The ladies did change favours: and then we,
[12:02.68]	Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
[12:06.50]	Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
[12:09.74]	We are again forsworn, in will and error.
[12:13.12]	Much upon this it is: and might not you
[12:16.43]	[To BOYET]
[12:17.31]	Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
[12:20.92]	Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
[12:24.67]	And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
[12:27.76]	And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
[12:31.43]	Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
[12:34.45]	You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
[12:37.83]	Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
[12:41.73]	You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
[12:45.04]	Wounds like a leaden sword.
[12:47.47]BOYET	Full merrily
[12:48.86]	Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
[12:52.54]BIRON	Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
[12:56.22]	[Enter COSTARD]
[12:57.10]	Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.
[13:00.63]COSTARD	O Lord, sir, they would know
[13:03.06]	Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
[13:06.95]BIRON	What, are there but three?
[13:09.23]COSTARD	No, sir; but it is vara fine,
[13:11.66]	For every one pursents three.
[13:14.23]BIRON	And three times thrice is nine.
[13:16.96]COSTARD	Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
[13:21.22]	You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
[13:25.41]	what we know:
[13:26.81]	I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--
[13:29.75]BIRON	Is not nine.
[13:31.08]COSTARD	Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
[13:35.56]BIRON	By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
[13:39.24]COSTARD	O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
[13:43.43]	by reckoning, sir.
[13:45.12]BIRON	How much is it?
[13:46.67]COSTARD	O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
[13:50.42]	sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
[13:54.46]	own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
[13:58.51]	in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
[14:01.74]BIRON	Art thou one of the Worthies?
[14:04.32]COSTARD	It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
[14:08.43]	Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
[14:12.48]	the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
[14:15.64]BIRON	Go, bid them prepare.
[14:17.55]COSTARD	We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
[14:21.23]	some care.
[14:22.41]	[Exit]
[14:23.29]FERDINAND	Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.
[14:27.19]BIRON	We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
[14:31.08]	To have one show worse than the king's and his company.
[14:35.57]FERDINAND	I say they shall not come.
[14:37.92]PRINCESS	Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
[14:41.38]	That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
[14:45.42]	Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
[14:49.32]	Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
[14:52.93]	Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
[14:56.82]	When great things labouring perish in their birth.
[15:00.94]BIRON	A right description of our sport, my lord.
[15:04.40]	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO]
[15:05.28]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
[15:09.25]	sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.
[15:12.93]	[Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper]
[15:13.81]PRINCESS	Doth this man serve God?
[15:16.02]BIRON	Why ask you?
[15:17.34]PRINCESS	He speaks not like a man of God's making.
[15:20.80]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
[15:24.77]	I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
[15:28.15]	fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
[15:31.90]	will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
[15:35.87]	I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!
[15:40.07]	[Exit]
[15:40.95]FERDINAND	Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
[15:45.07]	presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
[15:48.82]	Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
[15:52.79]	Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
[15:56.47]	these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
[16:00.36]	These four will change habits, and present the other five.
[16:05.00]BIRON	There is five in the first show.
[16:07.79]FERDINAND	You are deceived; 'tis not so.
[16:10.29]BIRON	The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
[16:14.41]	and the boy:--
[16:15.73]	Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
[16:19.63]	Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.
[16:23.90]FERDINAND	The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
[16:27.87]	[Enter COSTARD, for Pompey]
[16:28.75]COSTARD	I Pompey am,--
[16:30.07]BOYET	You lie, you are not he.
[16:32.21]COSTARD	I Pompey am,--
[16:33.53]BOYET	With libbard's head on knee.
[16:36.03]BIRON	Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
[16:39.78]	with thee.
[16:40.96]COSTARD	I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--
[16:44.05]DUMAIN	The Great.
[16:45.22]COSTARD	It is, 'Great,' sir:--
[16:46.84]	Pompey surnamed the Great;
[16:49.19]	That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
[16:53.24]	my foe to sweat:
[16:54.86]	And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
[16:59.49]	And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
[17:04.42]	If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.
[17:08.68]PRINCESS	Great thanks, great Pompey.
[17:11.04]COSTARD	'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
[17:15.08]	made a little fault in 'Great.'
[17:17.65]BIRON	My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
[17:21.92]	[Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander]
[17:22.80]SIR NATHANIEL	When in the world I lived, I was the world's
[17:26.48]	commander;
[17:27.66]	By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
[17:31.11]	conquering might:
[17:32.80]	My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--
[17:36.77]BOYET	Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.
[17:41.19]BIRON	Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.
[17:45.75]PRINCESS	The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.
[17:49.79]SIR NATHANIEL	When in the world I lived, I was the world's
[17:53.47]	commander,--
[17:54.65]BOYET	Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.
[17:58.18]BIRON	Pompey the Great,--
[17:59.87]COSTARD	Your servant, and Costard.
[18:02.15]BIRON	Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.
[18:05.82]COSTARD	[To SIR NATHANIEL] O, sir, you have overthrown
[18:08.62]	Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
[18:12.81]	the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
[18:16.78]	his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
[18:21.05]	to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
[18:25.02]	and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.
[18:29.06]	[SIR NATHANIEL retires]
[18:29.94]	There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an
[18:34.06]	honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
[18:37.74]	marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
[18:41.71]	bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
[18:45.24]	'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
[18:49.14]	a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.
[18:53.26]	[Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules]
[18:54.14]HOLOFERNES	Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
[18:57.52]	Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
[19:01.71]	And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
[19:05.10]	Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
[19:08.70]	Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
[19:11.42]	Ergo I come with this apology.
[19:14.07]	Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
[19:17.38]	[MOTH retires]
[19:18.26]	Judas I am,--
[19:19.51]DUMAIN	A Judas!
[19:20.54]HOLOFERNES	Not Iscariot, sir.
[19:22.23]	Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.
[19:24.88]DUMAIN	Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
[19:28.12]BIRON	A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?
[19:31.79]HOLOFERNES	Judas I am,--
[19:33.04]DUMAIN	The more shame for you, Judas.
[19:35.62]HOLOFERNES	What mean you, sir?
[19:37.38]BOYET	To make Judas hang himself.
[19:39.81]HOLOFERNES	Begin, sir; you are my elder.
[19:42.24]BIRON	Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
[19:45.84]HOLOFERNES	I will not be put out of countenance.
[19:49.00]BIRON	Because thou hast no face.
[19:51.35]HOLOFERNES	What is this?
[19:52.75]BOYET	A cittern-head.
[19:54.30]DUMAIN	The head of a bodkin.
[19:56.28]BIRON	A Death's face in a ring.
[19:58.56]LONGAVILLE	The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
[20:02.09]BOYET	The pommel of Caesar's falchion.
[20:04.89]DUMAIN	The carved-bone face on a flask.
[20:07.68]BIRON	Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
[20:10.92]DUMAIN	Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
[20:13.34]BIRON	Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
[20:16.80]	And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.
[20:21.06]HOLOFERNES	You have put me out of countenance.
[20:24.08]BIRON	False; we have given thee faces.
[20:26.80]HOLOFERNES	But you have out-faced them all.
[20:29.60]BIRON	An thou wert a lion, we would do so.
[20:32.61]BOYET	Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
[20:35.77]	And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?
[20:39.67]DUMAIN	For the latter end of his name.
[20:42.39]BIRON	For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!
[20:46.36]HOLOFERNES	This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
[20:49.97]BOYET	A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.
[20:54.53]	[HOLOFERNES retires]
[20:55.41]PRINCESS	Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
[20:59.16]	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector]
[21:00.04]BIRON	Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.
[21:04.09]DUMAIN	Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
[21:08.35]FERDINAND	Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
[21:11.95]BOYET	But is this Hector?
[21:13.79]FERDINAND	I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.
[21:17.25]LONGAVILLE	His leg is too big for Hector's.
[21:20.04]DUMAIN	More calf, certain.
[21:21.81]BOYET	No; he is best endued in the small.
[21:24.75]BIRON	This cannot be Hector.
[21:26.81]DUMAIN	He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
[21:30.41]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
[21:34.02]	Gave Hector a gift,--
[21:35.86]DUMAIN	A gilt nutmeg.
[21:37.33]BIRON	A lemon.
[21:38.36]LONGAVILLE	Stuck with cloves.
[21:40.12]DUMAIN	No, cloven.
[21:41.30]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Peace!--
[21:42.18]	The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
[21:45.78]	Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
[21:48.95]	A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
[21:53.06]	From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
[21:56.52]	I am that flower,--
[21:58.21]DUMAIN	That mint.
[21:59.39]LONGAVILLE	That columbine.
[22:00.93]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
[22:04.17]LONGAVILLE	I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.
[22:08.88]DUMAIN	Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
[22:11.38]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
[22:15.49]	beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
[22:19.61]	he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
[22:23.51]	[To the PRINCESS]
[22:24.39]	Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.
[22:28.36]PRINCESS	Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
[22:31.82]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.
[22:34.98]BOYET	[Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot,--
[22:37.48]DUMAIN	[Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
[22:40.06]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--
[22:43.15]COSTARD	The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
[22:47.12]	is two months on her way.
[22:49.40]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What meanest thou?
[22:51.16]COSTARD	Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
[22:55.21]	wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
[22:59.32]	her belly already: tis yours.
[23:01.82]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
[23:06.09]	die.
[23:06.83]COSTARD	Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
[23:11.09]	quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
[23:15.28]	him.
[23:16.02]DUMAIN	Most rare Pompey!
[23:17.71]BOYET	Renowned Pompey!
[23:19.33]BIRON	Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
[23:23.00]	Pompey the Huge!
[23:24.62]DUMAIN	Hector trembles.
[23:26.24]BIRON	Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
[23:30.06]	on! stir them on!
[23:31.68]DUMAIN	Hector will challenge him.
[23:34.04]BIRON	Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
[23:38.08]	sup a flea.
[23:39.33]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By the north pole, I do challenge thee.
[23:42.57]COSTARD	I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
[23:46.61]	I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
[23:50.58]	let me borrow my arms again.
[23:53.08]DUMAIN	Room for the incensed Worthies!
[23:55.80]COSTARD	I'll do it in my shirt.
[23:57.94]DUMAIN	Most resolute Pompey!
[23:59.92]MOTH	Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
[24:03.97]	not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
[24:08.23]	you? You will lose your reputation.
[24:11.17]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
[24:15.37]	in my shirt.
[24:16.69]DUMAIN	You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
[24:20.88]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
[24:23.75]BIRON	What reason have you for't?
[24:26.18]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
[24:30.00]	woolward for penance.
[24:31.99]BOYET	True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
[24:36.03]	linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
[24:40.00]	a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
[24:44.12]	his heart for a favour.
[24:46.25]	[Enter MERCADE]
[24:47.13]MERCADE	God save you, madam!
[24:48.97]PRINCESS	Welcome, Mercade;
[24:50.59]	But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
[24:54.05]MERCADE	I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
[24:57.28]	Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
[25:00.89]PRINCESS	Dead, for my life!
[25:02.58]MERCADE	Even so; my tale is told.
[25:04.78]BIRON	Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
[25:08.17]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
[25:12.07]	seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
[25:16.11]	discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
[25:20.23]	[Exeunt Worthies]
[25:21.11]FERDINAND	How fares your majesty?
[25:23.24]PRINCESS	Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.
[25:26.18]FERDINAND	Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.
[25:29.20]PRINCESS	Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
[25:32.66]	For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
[25:36.04]	Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
[25:39.50]	In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
[25:42.73]	The liberal opposition of our spirits,
[25:45.97]	If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
[25:49.28]	In the converse of breath: your gentleness
[25:52.81]	Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
[25:56.04]	A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
[25:59.43]	Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
[26:02.81]	For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
[26:05.97]FERDINAND	The extreme parts of time extremely forms
[26:09.50]	All causes to the purpose of his speed,
[26:12.81]	And often at his very loose decides
[26:15.90]	That which long process could not arbitrate:
[26:19.58]	And though the mourning brow of progeny
[26:22.96]	Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
[26:26.05]	The holy suit which fain it would convince,
[26:29.65]	Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
[26:33.33]	Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
[26:36.56]	From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
[26:40.61]	Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
[26:43.92]	As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
[26:47.37]PRINCESS	I understand you not: my griefs are double.
[26:50.90]BIRON	Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
[26:54.87]	And by these badges understand the king.
[26:58.26]	For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
[27:01.86]	Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
[27:06.05]	Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
[27:09.80]	Even to the opposed end of our intents:
[27:13.11]	And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
[27:16.35]	As love is full of unbefitting strains,
[27:19.66]	All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
[27:23.04]	Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
[27:26.79]	Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
[27:30.62]	Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
[27:34.07]	To every varied object in his glance:
[27:37.23]	Which parti-coated presence of loose love
[27:40.76]	Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
[27:44.00]	Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
[27:47.38]	Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
[27:51.35]	Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
[27:54.59]	Our love being yours, the error that love makes
[27:58.49]	Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
[28:02.31]	By being once false for ever to be true
[28:05.69]	To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
[28:09.30]	And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
[28:12.68]	Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
[28:16.06]PRINCESS	We have received your letters full of love;
[28:19.67]	Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
[28:22.83]	And, in our maiden council, rated them
[28:25.99]	At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
[28:29.37]	As bombast and as lining to the time:
[28:32.54]	But more devout than this in our respects
[28:36.07]	Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
[28:39.89]	In their own fashion, like a merriment.
[28:43.13]DUMAIN	Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
[28:46.88]LONGAVILLE	So did our looks.
[28:48.57]ROSALINE	We did not quote them so.
[28:50.85]FERDINAND	Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
[28:54.01]	Grant us your loves.
[28:55.92]PRINCESS	A time, methinks, too short
[28:58.28]	To make a world-without-end bargain in.
[29:01.59]	No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
[29:05.12]	Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
[29:08.72]	If for my love, as there is no such cause,
[29:12.18]	You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
[29:15.78]	Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
[29:19.53]	To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
[29:22.62]	Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
[29:26.22]	There stay until the twelve celestial signs
[29:29.90]	Have brought about the annual reckoning.
[29:33.28]	If this austere insociable life
[29:36.08]	Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
[29:39.75]	If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
[29:43.72]	Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
[29:47.11]	But that it bear this trial and last love;
[29:50.64]	Then, at the expiration of the year,
[29:53.65]	Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
[29:57.62]	And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
[30:01.15]	I will be thine; and till that instant shut
[30:04.76]	My woeful self up in a mourning house,
[30:07.99]	Raining the tears of lamentation
[30:10.86]	For the remembrance of my father's death.
[30:14.32]	If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
[30:17.70]	Neither entitled in the other's heart.
[30:20.94]FERDINAND	If this, or more than this, I would deny,
[30:24.25]	To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
[30:28.00]	The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
[30:31.60]	Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
[30:35.13]BIRON	(And what to me, my love? and what to me?
[30:38.37]ROSALINE	You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,
[30:42.04]	You are attaint with faults and perjury:
[30:45.43]	Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
[30:48.73]	A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
[30:52.48]	But seek the weary beds of people sick)
[30:55.79]DUMAIN	But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
[30:59.54]KATHARINE	A beard, fair health, and honesty;
[31:02.34]	With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
[31:06.31]DUMAIN	O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
[31:09.55]KATHARINE	Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
[31:12.86]	I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
[31:16.83]	Come when the king doth to my lady come;
[31:20.21]	Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
[31:23.89]DUMAIN	I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
[31:27.71]KATHARINE	Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
[31:31.09]LONGAVILLE	What says Maria?
[31:32.71]MARIA	At the twelvemonth's end
[31:34.99]	I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
[31:38.96]LONGAVILLE	I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
[31:42.71]MARIA	The liker you; few taller are so young.
[31:45.95]BIRON	Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
[31:49.04]	Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
[31:52.35]	What humble suit attends thy answer there:
[31:55.88]	Impose some service on me for thy love.
[31:59.19]ROSALINE	Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
[32:02.42]	Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
[32:06.25]	Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
[32:09.85]	Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
[32:13.23]	Which you on all estates will execute
[32:16.47]	That lie within the mercy of your wit.
[32:19.70]	To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
[32:23.60]	And therewithal to win me, if you please,
[32:26.98]	Without the which I am not to be won,
[32:30.15]	You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
[32:34.12]	Visit the speechless sick and still converse
[32:37.87]	With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
[32:41.69]	With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
[32:45.15]	To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
[32:48.53]BIRON	To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
[32:52.28]	It cannot be; it is impossible:
[32:54.93]	Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
[32:57.87]ROSALINE	Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
[33:01.55]	Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
[33:05.30]	Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
[33:09.05]	A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
[33:12.14]	Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
[33:15.60]	Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
[33:19.05]	Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
[33:23.17]	Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
[33:26.63]	And I will have you and that fault withal;
[33:30.16]	But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
[33:33.83]	And I shall find you empty of that fault,
[33:37.29]	Right joyful of your reformation.
[33:40.16]BIRON	A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
[33:43.76]	I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
[33:47.07]PRINCESS	[To FERDINAND] Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.
[33:50.89]FERDINAND	No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
[33:54.20]BIRON	Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
[33:57.66]	Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
[34:01.12]	Might well have made our sport a comedy.
[34:04.50]FERDINAND	Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
[34:08.03]	And then 'twill end.
[34:09.87]BIRON	That's too long for a play.
[34:12.29]	[Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO]
[34:13.18]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--
[34:15.60]PRINCESS	Was not that Hector?
[34:17.52]DUMAIN	The worthy knight of Troy.
[34:19.87]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
[34:23.91]	a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
[34:27.89]	plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
[34:31.78]	esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
[34:35.98]	the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
[34:40.17]	owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
[34:44.29]	end of our show.
[34:45.90]FERDINAND	Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
[34:49.14]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Holla! approach.
[34:50.68]	[Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD,
[34:51.12]	+ and others]
[34:51.57]	This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
[34:55.39]	the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
[34:59.29]	cuckoo. Ver, begin.
[35:00.98]	[THE SONG]
[35:01.86]	SPRING.
[35:02.82]	When daisies pied and violets blue
[35:05.83]	And lady-smocks all silver-white
[35:08.70]	And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
[35:11.35]	Do paint the meadows with delight,
[35:14.29]	The cuckoo then, on every tree,
[35:16.94]	Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
[35:20.54]	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
[35:23.11]	Unpleasing to a married ear!
[35:25.62]	When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
[35:28.70]	And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
[35:32.01]	When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
[35:35.25]	And maidens bleach their summer smocks
[35:38.56]	The cuckoo then, on every tree,
[35:41.21]	Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
[35:44.81]	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
[35:47.38]	Unpleasing to a married ear!
[35:49.88]	WINTER.
[35:50.84]	When icicles hang by the wall
[35:53.49]	And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
[35:56.65]	And Tom bears logs into the hall
[35:59.52]	And milk comes frozen home in pail,
[36:02.53]	When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
[36:05.77]	Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
[36:09.37]	Tu-who, a merry note,
[36:11.28]	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
[36:14.37]	When all aloud the wind doth blow
[36:17.31]	And coughing drowns the parson's saw
[36:20.48]	And birds sit brooding in the snow
[36:23.49]	And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
[36:26.58]	When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
[36:29.67]	Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
[36:33.27]	Tu-who, a merry note,
[36:35.18]	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
[36:38.27]DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of
[36:42.39]	Apollo. You that way: we this way.
