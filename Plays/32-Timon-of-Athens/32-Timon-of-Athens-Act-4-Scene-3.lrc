[00:00.49]	[Woods and cave, near the seashore.,]
[00:01.47]	[Enter TIMON, from the cave]
[00:02.46]	O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
[00:06.49]	Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
[00:10.19]	Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,
[00:14.30]	Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
[00:17.92]	Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
[00:22.69]	The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
[00:26.55]	To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,
[00:31.24]	But by contempt of nature.
[00:33.87]	Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;
[00:37.82]	The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
[00:41.84]	The beggar native honour.
[00:44.39]	It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
[00:48.42]	The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
[00:52.94]	In purity of manhood stand upright,
[00:56.31]	And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
[01:00.18]	So are they all; for every grise of fortune
[01:04.21]	Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
[01:08.24]	Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
[01:12.02]	There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
[01:16.13]	But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
[01:19.99]	All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
[01:23.78]	His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:
[01:27.64]	Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
[01:31.92]	[Digging]
[01:32.90]	Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
[01:37.18]	With thy most operant poison! What is here?
[01:41.12]	Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
[01:45.32]	I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
[01:49.59]	Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
[01:54.20]	Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
[01:58.64]	Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
[02:03.16]	Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
[02:07.85]	Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
[02:12.37]	This yellow slave
[02:14.34]	Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
[02:18.86]	Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
[02:22.89]	And give them title, knee and approbation
[02:26.76]	With senators on the bench: this is it
[02:30.37]	That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
[02:34.16]	She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
[02:38.35]	Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
[02:42.79]	To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
[02:46.65]	Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
[02:50.93]	Among the route of nations, I will make thee
[02:55.04]	Do thy right nature.
[02:57.18]	[March afar off]
[02:58.16]	Ha! a drum? Thou'rt quick,
[03:00.63]	But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,
[03:04.99]	When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
[03:08.77]	Nay, stay thou out for earnest.
[03:11.73]	[Keeping some gold]
[03:12.72]	[Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in
[03:13.21]	+ warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA]
[03:13.70]ALCIBIADES	What art thou there? speak.
[03:16.33]TIMON	A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
[03:20.61]	For showing me again the eyes of man!
[03:24.14]ALCIBIADES	What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,
[03:28.17]	That art thyself a man?
[03:30.56]TIMON	I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
[03:33.93]	For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
[03:37.63]	That I might love thee something.
[03:40.84]ALCIBIADES	I know thee well;
[03:42.73]	But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
[03:46.92]TIMON	I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,
[03:51.28]	I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;
[03:54.81]	With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:
[03:59.09]	Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
[04:02.71]	Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
[04:07.23]	Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
[04:11.34]	For all her cherubim look.
[04:13.97]PHRYNIA	Thy lips rot off!
[04:15.86]TIMON	I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
[04:19.81]	To thine own lips again.
[04:22.27]ALCIBIADES	How came the noble Timon to this change?
[04:26.06]TIMON	As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
[04:30.00]	But then renew I could not, like the moon;
[04:33.87]	There were no suns to borrow of.
[04:36.99]ALCIBIADES	Noble Timon,
[04:38.47]	What friendship may I do thee?
[04:41.43]TIMON	None, but to
[04:42.91]	Maintain my opinion.
[04:45.05]ALCIBIADES	What is it, Timon?
[04:46.94]TIMON	Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou
[04:51.30]	wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art
[04:55.98]	a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for
[05:00.18]	thou art a man!
[05:01.90]ALCIBIADES	I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
[05:05.85]TIMON	Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
[05:09.55]ALCIBIADES	I see them now; then was a blessed time.
[05:13.25]TIMON	As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
[05:17.44]TIMANDRA	Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world
[05:21.47]	Voiced so regardfully?
[05:23.77]TIMON	Art thou Timandra?
[05:25.75]TIMANDRA	Yes.
[05:26.57]TIMON	Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
[05:31.17]	Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
[05:35.61]	Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
[05:39.81]	For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
[05:44.33]	To the tub-fast and the diet.
[05:47.21]TIMANDRA	Hang thee, monster!
[05:49.18]ALCIBIADES	Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
[05:52.88]	Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
[05:56.58]	I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
[06:00.61]	The want whereof doth daily make revolt
[06:04.39]	In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,
[06:08.66]	How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
[06:12.45]	Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
[06:16.97]	But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--
[06:21.16]TIMON	I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.
[06:25.11]ALCIBIADES	I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
[06:28.97]TIMON	How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
[06:33.25]	I had rather be alone.
[06:35.55]ALCIBIADES	Why, fare thee well:
[06:37.61]	Here is some gold for thee.
[06:40.32]TIMON	Keep it, I cannot eat it.
[06:42.79]ALCIBIADES	When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--
[06:46.57]TIMON	Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
[06:49.28]ALCIBIADES	Ay, Timon, and have cause.
[06:51.75]TIMON	The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
[06:55.78]	And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
[06:59.56]ALCIBIADES	Why me, Timon?
[07:01.12]TIMON	That, by killing of villains,
[07:03.92]	Thou wast born to conquer my country.
[07:07.45]	Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;
[07:11.23]	Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
[07:14.60]	Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
[07:18.96]	In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
[07:22.99]	Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
[07:26.94]	He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
[07:31.46]	It is her habit only that is honest,
[07:34.91]	Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
[07:39.02]	Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
[07:43.63]	That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
[07:48.07]	Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
[07:51.60]	But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
[07:56.62]	Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
[08:01.39]	Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
[08:04.76]	Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
[08:09.20]	And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
[08:13.64]	Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
[08:17.67]	Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
[08:22.19]	Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
[08:26.63]	Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:
[08:31.07]	Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
[08:34.85]	Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
[08:38.63]ALCIBIADES	Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
[08:42.66]	givest me,
[08:43.98]	Not all thy counsel.
[08:46.11]TIMON	Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse
[08:50.06]	upon thee!
[08:51.38]PHRYNIA	|
[08:51.87]	| Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?
[08:55.98]TIMANDRA	|
[08:56.47]TIMON	Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
[09:00.42]	And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
[09:04.53]	Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,
[09:08.48]	Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear
[09:12.59]	Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
[09:16.62]	The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,
[09:21.14]	I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
[09:25.41]	And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
[09:29.77]	Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
[09:33.72]	Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
[09:37.67]	And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
[09:42.27]	Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
[09:46.87]	With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,
[09:51.31]	No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;
[09:55.84]	Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,
[09:59.86]	A pox of wrinkles!
[10:01.84]PHRYNIA	|
[10:02.33]	| Well, more gold: what then?
[10:04.88]TIMANDRA	| Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.
[10:08.91]TIMON	Consumptions sow
[10:10.80]	In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
[10:15.24]	And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
[10:19.68]	That he may never more false title plead,
[10:23.54]	Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
[10:27.90]	That scolds against the quality of flesh,
[10:31.77]	And not believes himself: down with the nose,
[10:35.88]	Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
[10:40.07]	Of him that, his particular to foresee,
[10:43.69]	Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate
[10:47.96]	ruffians bald;
[10:49.61]	And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
[10:53.64]	Derive some pain from you: plague all;
[10:57.17]	That your activity may defeat and quell
[11:00.95]	The source of all erection. There's more gold:
[11:05.15]	Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
[11:09.01]	And ditches grave you all!
[11:11.64]PHRYNIA	|
[11:12.13]	| More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.
[11:16.33]TIMANDRA	|
[11:16.82]TIMON	More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
[11:21.92]ALCIBIADES	Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:
[11:26.44]	If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.
[11:30.14]TIMON	If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
[11:33.92]ALCIBIADES	I never did thee harm.
[11:36.22]TIMON	Yes, thou spokest well of me.
[11:39.02]ALCIBIADES	Call'st thou that harm?
[11:41.40]TIMON	Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
[11:45.27]	Thy beagles with thee.
[11:47.57]ALCIBIADES	We but offend him. Strike!
[11:50.12]	[Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA,
[11:50.61]	+ and TIMANDRA]
[11:51.11]TIMON	That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
[11:55.14]	Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,
[11:58.92]	[Digging]
[11:59.90]	Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,
[12:04.01]	Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
[12:08.04]	Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
[12:12.40]	Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
[12:16.18]	The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
[12:20.05]	With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
[12:24.49]	Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;
[12:28.76]	Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
[12:32.79]	From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
[12:36.98]	Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
[12:40.77]	Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
[12:44.55]	Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
[12:48.82]	Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face
[12:52.94]	Hath to the marbled mansion all above
[12:56.55]	Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
[13:00.09]	Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
[13:04.36]	Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts
[13:08.72]	And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
[13:12.75]	That from it all consideration slips!
[13:16.29]	[Enter APEMANTUS]
[13:17.27]	More man? plague, plague!
[13:19.66]APEMANTUS	I was directed hither: men report
[13:22.86]	Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.
[13:27.14]TIMON	'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
[13:31.08]	Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!
[13:35.20]APEMANTUS	This is in thee a nature but infected;
[13:38.81]	A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
[13:42.02]	From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
[13:46.54]	This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
[13:50.82]	Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;
[13:55.34]	Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot
[13:59.45]	That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
[14:03.40]	By putting on the cunning of a carper.
[14:07.01]	Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
[14:11.04]	By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
[14:15.24]	And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
[14:19.43]	Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
[14:23.87]	And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
[14:27.82]	Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
[14:32.75]	To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
[14:36.86]	That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
[14:41.14]	Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.
[14:45.58]TIMON	Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.
[14:49.36]APEMANTUS	Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
[14:53.71]	A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
[14:57.66]	That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
[15:01.94]	Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
[15:06.62]	That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
[15:10.73]	And skip where thou point'st out? will the
[15:14.68]	cold brook,
[15:16.08]	Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
[15:20.02]	To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
[15:24.79]	Whose naked natures live in an the spite
[15:28.66]	Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
[15:32.93]	To the conflicting elements exposed,
[15:36.39]	Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
[15:40.25]	O, thou shalt find--
[15:42.22]TIMON	A fool of thee: depart.
[15:44.53]APEMANTUS	I love thee better now than e'er I did.
[15:48.23]TIMON	I hate thee worse.
[15:50.20]APEMANTUS	Why?
[15:51.02]TIMON	Thou flatter'st misery.
[15:53.41]APEMANTUS	I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.
[15:57.27]TIMON	Why dost thou seek me out?
[15:59.90]APEMANTUS	To vex thee.
[16:01.38]TIMON	Always a villain's office or a fool's.
[16:05.00]	Dost please thyself in't?
[16:07.55]APEMANTUS	Ay.
[16:08.29]TIMON	What! a knave too?
[16:10.18]APEMANTUS	If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
[16:14.12]	To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
[16:18.15]	Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,
[16:22.51]	Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
[16:25.96]	Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:
[16:29.91]	The one is filling still, never complete;
[16:33.69]	The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
[16:37.97]	Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
[16:41.91]	Worse than the worst, content.
[16:44.79]	Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
[16:48.90]TIMON	Not by his breath that is more miserable.
[16:52.77]	Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm
[16:56.80]	With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
[17:00.66]	Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
[17:05.27]	The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
[17:09.70]	To such as may the passive drugs of it
[17:13.40]	Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself
[17:17.93]	In general riot; melted down thy youth
[17:21.54]	In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
[17:25.66]	The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
[17:29.52]	The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
[17:33.30]	Who had the world as my confectionary,
[17:36.92]	The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
[17:41.52]	At duty, more than I could frame employment,
[17:45.55]	That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
[17:49.33]	Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
[17:53.36]	Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
[17:57.56]	For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
[18:01.50]	That never knew but better, is some burden:
[18:05.45]	Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
[18:09.48]	Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
[18:14.25]	They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
[18:18.60]	If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
[18:22.72]	Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
[18:26.74]	To some she beggar and compounded thee
[18:30.44]	Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
[18:33.90]	If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
[18:38.09]	Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
[18:41.71]APEMANTUS	Art thou proud yet?
[18:43.76]TIMON	Ay, that I am not thee.
[18:46.07]APEMANTUS	I, that I was
[18:47.63]	No prodigal.
[18:49.11]TIMON	I, that I am one now:
[18:51.25]	Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
[18:55.27]	I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
[18:59.55]	That the whole life of Athens were in this!
[19:03.58]	Thus would I eat it.
[19:05.72]	[Eating a root]
[19:06.70]APEMANTUS	Here; I will mend thy feast.
[19:09.42]	[Offering him a root]
[19:10.40]TIMON	First mend my company, take away thyself.
[19:14.18]APEMANTUS	So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.
[19:18.46]TIMON	'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;
[19:22.32]	if not, I would it were.
[19:24.71]APEMANTUS	What wouldst thou have to Athens?
[19:27.92]TIMON	Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
[19:31.78]	Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.
[19:35.81]APEMANTUS	Here is no use for gold.
[19:38.27]TIMON	The best and truest;
[19:40.41]	For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.
[19:44.36]APEMANTUS	Where liest o' nights, Timon?
[19:47.07]TIMON	Under that's above me.
[19:49.37]	Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?
[19:52.83]APEMANTUS	Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat
[19:57.43]	it.
[19:58.17]TIMON	Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
[20:02.28]APEMANTUS	Where wouldst thou send it?
[20:05.00]TIMON	To sauce thy dishes.
[20:07.13]APEMANTUS	The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
[20:11.74]	extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
[20:16.34]	and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much
[20:20.62]	curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art
[20:25.06]	despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
[20:29.41]	thee, eat it.
[20:30.89]TIMON	On what I hate I feed not.
[20:33.53]APEMANTUS	Dost hate a medlar?
[20:35.58]TIMON	Ay, though it look like thee.
[20:38.38]APEMANTUS	An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst
[20:42.98]	have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
[20:47.59]	ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
[20:52.35]TIMON	Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou
[20:57.04]	ever know beloved?
[20:59.01]APEMANTUS	Myself.
[21:00.08]TIMON	I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a
[21:04.69]	dog.
[21:05.51]APEMANTUS	What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
[21:10.28]	to thy flatterers?
[21:12.25]TIMON	Women nearest; but men, men are the things
[21:16.12]	themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,
[21:20.47]	Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?
[21:23.68]APEMANTUS	Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
[21:27.46]TIMON	Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
[21:32.15]	men, and remain a beast with the beasts?
[21:35.85]APEMANTUS	Ay, Timon.
[21:37.08]TIMON	A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'
[21:41.44]	attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
[21:45.71]	beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would
[21:50.24]	eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
[21:54.51]	suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
[21:59.28]	the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
[22:03.64]	torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
[22:07.83]	breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy
[22:12.27]	greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
[22:17.04]	hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
[22:21.23]	unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
[22:25.67]	make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
[22:30.28]	thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:
[22:34.72]	wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
[22:39.16]	leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
[22:43.60]	the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
[22:48.45]	thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
[22:52.72]	defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
[22:57.16]	were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
[23:01.68]	thou already, that seest not thy loss in
[23:05.47]	transformation!
[23:07.19]APEMANTUS	If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
[23:11.88]	mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
[23:16.48]	Athens is become a forest of beasts.
[23:19.94]TIMON	How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?
[23:25.45]APEMANTUS	Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
[23:29.89]	company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
[23:34.33]	and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll
[23:38.93]	see thee again.
[23:40.66]TIMON	When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
[23:45.42]	welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
[23:50.36]APEMANTUS	Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
[23:54.14]TIMON	Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
[23:58.09]APEMANTUS	A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
[24:02.12]TIMON	All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
[24:06.23]APEMANTUS	There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
[24:10.25]TIMON	If I name thee.
[24:11.98]	I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
[24:16.09]APEMANTUS	I would my tongue could rot them off!
[24:19.63]TIMON	Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
[24:22.67]	Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
[24:26.45]	I swound to see thee.
[24:28.67]APEMANTUS	Would thou wouldst burst!
[24:31.22]TIMON	Away,
[24:32.13]	Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
[24:36.15]	A stone by thee.
[24:37.96]	[Throws a stone at him]
[24:38.95]APEMANTUS	Beast!
[24:39.94]TIMON	Slave!
[24:40.92]APEMANTUS	Toad!
[24:41.83]TIMON	Rogue, rogue, rogue!
[24:43.80]	I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
[24:48.49]	But even the mere necessities upon 't.
[24:52.02]	Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
[24:55.72]	Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
[24:59.67]	Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
[25:03.53]	That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
[25:07.56]	[To the gold]
[25:08.55]	O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
[25:12.49]	'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
[25:16.85]	Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
[25:20.63]	Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
[25:24.99]	Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
[25:29.02]	That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
[25:32.88]	That solder'st close impossibilities,
[25:36.42]	And makest them kiss! that speak'st with
[25:40.20]	every tongue,
[25:41.76]	To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
[25:45.55]	Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
[25:49.74]	Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
[25:53.77]	May have the world in empire!
[25:56.65]APEMANTUS	Would 'twere so!
[25:58.37]	But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:
[26:02.57]	Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
[26:05.77]TIMON	Throng'd to!
[26:07.25]APEMANTUS	Ay.
[26:07.99]TIMON	Thy back, I prithee.
[26:10.05]APEMANTUS	Live, and love thy misery.
[26:12.60]TIMON	Long live so, and so die.
[26:15.06]	[Exit APEMANTUS]
[26:16.05]	I am quit.
[26:17.37]	Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.
[26:21.56]	[Enter Banditti]
[26:22.55]First Bandit	Where should he have this gold? It is some poor
[26:26.90]	fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the
[26:31.34]	mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his
[26:35.62]	friends, drove him into this melancholy.
[26:39.32]Second Bandit	It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
[26:43.10]Third Bandit	Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not
[26:47.38]	for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously
[26:51.82]	reserve it, how shall's get it?
[26:54.77]Second Bandit	True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.
[26:58.80]First Bandit	Is not this he?
[27:00.53]Banditti	Where?
[27:01.52]Second Bandit	'Tis his description.
[27:03.65]Third Bandit	He; I know him.
[27:05.30]Banditti	Save thee, Timon.
[27:07.11]TIMON	Now, thieves?
[27:08.59]Banditti	Soldiers, not thieves.
[27:10.81]TIMON	Both too; and women's sons.
[27:13.44]Banditti	We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
[27:17.63]TIMON	Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
[27:21.74]	Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
[27:26.18]	Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
[27:30.54]	The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
[27:34.57]	The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
[27:38.68]	Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
[27:42.79]First Bandit	We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
[27:46.66]	As beasts and birds and fishes.
[27:49.70]TIMON	Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
[27:54.30]	You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
[27:58.33]	That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
[28:02.85]	In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
[28:07.13]	In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
[28:10.75]	Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
[28:15.27]	Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
[28:19.62]	And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
[28:23.82]	His antidotes are poison, and he slays
[28:27.44]	Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
[28:31.88]	Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
[28:35.66]	Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
[28:39.77]	The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
[28:44.21]	Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
[28:48.40]	And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
[28:52.51]	The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
[28:56.79]	The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
[29:00.98]	That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
[29:05.17]	From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
[29:09.29]	The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
[29:13.81]	Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
[29:18.16]	Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
[29:22.44]	All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
[29:26.47]	Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
[29:30.17]	But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
[29:34.44]	I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.
[29:38.88]Third Bandit	Has almost charmed me from my profession, by
[29:42.99]	persuading me to it.
[29:45.13]First Bandit	'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
[29:49.74]	us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.
[29:53.52]Second Bandit	I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.
[29:58.29]First Bandit	Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
[30:02.89]	so miserable but a man may be true.
[30:06.26]	[Exeunt Banditti]
[30:07.25]	[Enter FLAVIUS]
[30:08.24]FLAVIUS	O you gods!
[30:09.63]	Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
[30:13.50]	Full of decay and failing? O monument
[30:17.03]	And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
[30:20.90]	What an alteration of honour
[30:23.78]	Has desperate want made!
[30:26.24]	What viler thing upon the earth than friends
[30:30.44]	Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
[30:34.46]	How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
[30:38.82]	When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
[30:42.60]	Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
[30:46.14]	Those that would mischief me than those that do!
[30:50.58]	Has caught me in his eye: I will present
[30:54.36]	My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,
[30:58.14]	Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
[31:02.50]TIMON	Away! what art thou?
[31:04.56]FLAVIUS	Have you forgot me, sir?
[31:06.94]TIMON	Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
[31:10.72]	Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
[31:15.74]FLAVIUS	An honest poor servant of yours.
[31:18.86]TIMON	Then I know thee not:
[31:21.08]	I never had honest man about me, I; all
[31:24.70]	I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
[31:29.14]FLAVIUS	The gods are witness,
[31:31.36]	Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
[31:35.31]	For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
[31:39.33]TIMON	What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I
[31:43.03]	love thee,
[31:44.35]	Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
[31:48.21]	Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
[31:52.00]	But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
[31:56.35]	Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
[32:01.37]FLAVIUS	I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
[32:04.90]	To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
[32:09.76]	To entertain me as your steward still.
[32:13.37]TIMON	Had I a steward
[32:15.18]	So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
[32:18.88]	It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
[32:22.75]	Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
[32:26.45]	Was born of woman.
[32:28.42]	Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
[32:32.45]	You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
[32:36.15]	One honest man--mistake me not--but one;
[32:39.77]	No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.
[32:43.05]	How fain would I have hated all mankind!
[32:46.84]	And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
[32:51.03]	I fell with curses.
[32:53.09]	Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
[32:57.20]	For, by oppressing and betraying me,
[33:00.57]	Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
[33:04.76]	For many so arrive at second masters,
[33:08.30]	Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
[33:12.57]	For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--
[33:16.60]	Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
[33:20.05]	If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
[33:24.90]	Expecting in return twenty for one?
[33:28.27]FLAVIUS	No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
[33:32.14]	Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
[33:36.17]	You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
[33:41.10]	Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
[33:45.29]	That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
[33:49.57]	Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
[33:53.10]	Care of your food and living; and, believe it,
[33:57.22]	My most honour'd lord,
[33:59.52]	For any benefit that points to me,
[34:02.81]	Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
[34:06.59]	For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
[34:11.03]	To requite me, by making rich yourself.
[34:14.65]TIMON	Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
[34:18.43]	Here, take: the gods out of my misery
[34:21.88]	Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
[34:26.24]	But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
[34:30.60]	Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
[34:34.38]	But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
[34:38.74]	Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
[34:42.60]	What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
[34:47.04]	Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
[34:50.74]	blasted woods,
[34:52.38]	And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
[34:56.50]	And so farewell and thrive.
[34:59.21]FLAVIUS	O, let me stay,
[35:00.85]	And comfort you, my master.
[35:03.48]TIMON	If thou hatest curses,
[35:05.79]	Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:
[35:09.90]	Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.
[35:14.09]	[Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave]
