[00:00.39]	[A Senator's house.,]
[00:01.18]	[Enter Senator, with papers in his hand]
[00:01.97]Senator	And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore
[00:05.45]	He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
[00:08.74]	Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
[00:12.23]	Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.
[00:15.45]	If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,
[00:18.48]	And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
[00:21.57]	If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more
[00:24.92]	Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
[00:28.08]	Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,
[00:31.43]	And able horses. No porter at his gate,
[00:34.33]	But rather one that smiles and still invites
[00:37.68]	All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason
[00:40.84]	Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
[00:43.86]	Caphis, I say!
[00:45.11]	[Enter CAPHIS]
[00:45.90]CAPHIS	Here, sir; what is your pleasure?
[00:48.33]Senator	Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;
[00:51.75]	Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased
[00:54.91]	With slight denial, nor then silenced when--
[00:58.07]	'Commend me to your master'--and the cap
[01:00.96]	Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
[01:04.12]	My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
[01:07.08]	Out of mine own; his days and times are past
[01:10.36]	And my reliances on his fracted dates
[01:13.26]	Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
[01:16.42]	But must not break my back to heal his finger;
[01:19.84]	Immediate are my needs, and my relief
[01:22.66]	Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
[01:26.02]	But find supply immediate. Get you gone:
[01:28.98]	Put on a most importunate aspect,
[01:31.54]	A visage of demand; for, I do fear,
[01:34.11]	When every feather sticks in his own wing,
[01:37.26]	Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
[01:40.09]	Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.
[01:43.18]CAPHIS	I go, sir.
[01:44.17]Senator	'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,
[01:47.13]	And have the dates in contempt.
[01:49.56]CAPHIS	I will, sir.
[01:50.68]Senator	Go.
[01:51.27]	[Exeunt]
