[00:00.44]	[A room in Sempronius' house.,]
[00:01.32]	[Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's]
[00:02.21]SEMPRONIUS	Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove
[00:05.52]	all others?
[00:06.77]	He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
[00:10.46]	And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
[00:13.33]	Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
[00:16.65]	Owe their estates unto him.
[00:19.08]Servant	My lord,
[00:20.11]	They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
[00:24.38]	They have au denied him.
[00:26.59]SEMPRONIUS	How! have they denied him?
[00:28.88]	Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
[00:32.12]	And does he send to me? Three? hum!
[00:34.99]	It shows but little love or judgment in him:
[00:38.67]	Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
[00:42.28]	physicians,
[00:43.54]	Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
[00:47.66]	Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,
[00:51.35]	That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,
[00:55.62]	But his occasion might have woo'd me first;
[00:59.23]	For, in my conscience, I was the first man
[01:02.69]	That e'er received gift from him:
[01:05.57]	And does he think so backwardly of me now,
[01:09.10]	That I'll requite its last? No:
[01:11.75]	So it may prove an argument of laughter
[01:15.14]	To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
[01:19.19]	I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
[01:22.95]	Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
[01:26.64]	I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
[01:30.69]	And with their faint reply this answer join;
[01:34.37]	Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
[01:38.13]	[Exit]
[01:39.01]Servant	Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
[01:42.92]	devil knew not what he did when he made man
[01:46.60]	politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot
[01:50.36]	think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
[01:54.34]	set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
[01:58.17]	appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
[02:02.07]	like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
[02:06.05]	whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
[02:09.81]	politic love.
[02:11.21]	This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
[02:15.04]	Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,
[02:18.72]	Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
[02:22.85]	Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
[02:26.16]	Now to guard sure their master.
[02:28.89]	And this is all a liberal course allows;
[02:32.28]	Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
[02:36.18]	[Exit]
