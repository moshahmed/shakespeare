[01:25.00]	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and
[01:25.43]	+ Attendants]
[01:25.86]DUKE VINCENTIO	Escalus.
[01:26.88]ESCALUS	My lord.
[01:27.89]DUKE VINCENTIO	Of government the properties to unfold,
[01:31.14]	Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
[01:35.05]	Since I am put to know that your own science
[01:38.73]	Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
[01:42.06]	My strength can give you: then no more remains,
[01:45.82]	But that to your sufficiency [ ]
[01:48.78]	[ ] as your Worth is able,
[01:51.24]	And let them work. The nature of our people,
[01:54.79]	Our city's institutions, and the terms
[01:57.97]	For common justice, you're as pregnant in
[02:01.37]	As art and practise hath enriched any
[02:04.55]	That we remember. There is our commission,
[02:07.95]	From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
[02:12.00]	I say, bid come before us Angelo.
[02:14.74]	[Exit an Attendant]
[02:15.61]	What figure of us think you he will bear?
[02:19.01]	For you must know, we have with special soul
[02:22.62]	Elected him our absence to supply,
[02:25.52]	Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
[02:29.28]	And given his deputation all the organs
[02:32.60]	Of our own power: what think you of it?
[02:35.78]ESCALUS	If any in Vienna be of worth
[02:38.32]	To undergo such ample grace and honour,
[02:41.57]	It is Lord Angelo.
[02:43.30]DUKE	VINCENTIO Look where he comes.
[02:45.91]	[Enter ANGELO]
[02:46.78]ANGELO	Always obedient to your grace's will,
[02:49.88]	I come to know your pleasure.
[02:52.42]DUKE VINCENTIO	Angelo,
[02:53.36]	There is a kind of character in thy life,
[02:56.75]	That to the observer doth thy history
[02:59.94]	Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
[03:03.26]	Are not thine own so proper as to waste
[03:06.59]	Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
[03:09.77]	Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
[03:13.24]	Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
[03:17.22]	Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
[03:20.47]	As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
[03:24.74]	But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
[03:28.21]	The smallest scruple of her excellence
[03:31.46]	But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
[03:34.93]	Herself the glory of a creditor,
[03:37.68]	Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
[03:41.30]	To one that can my part in him advertise;
[03:44.69]	Hold therefore, Angelo:--
[03:46.72]	In our remove be thou at full ourself;
[03:49.90]	Mortality and mercy in Vienna
[03:52.50]	Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
[03:55.90]	Though first in question, is thy secondary.
[03:59.37]	Take thy commission.
[04:01.25]ANGELO	Now, good my lord,
[04:02.92]	Let there be some more test made of my metal,
[04:06.60]	Before so noble and so great a figure
[04:09.78]	Be stamp'd upon it.
[04:11.59]DUKE VINCENTIO	No more evasion:
[04:13.18]	We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
[04:16.80]	Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
[04:20.49]	Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
[04:24.25]	That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
[04:28.08]	Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
[04:31.91]	As time and our concernings shall importune,
[04:35.53]	How it goes with us, and do look to know
[04:38.85]	What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
[04:42.40]	To the hopeful execution do I leave you
[04:45.72]	Of your commissions.
[04:47.60]ANGELO	Yet give leave, my lord,
[04:49.70]	That we may bring you something on the way.
[04:53.24]DUKE VINCENTIO	My haste may not admit it;
[04:55.56]	Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
[04:58.81]	With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
[05:02.35]	So to enforce or qualify the laws
[05:05.24]	As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
[05:08.93]	I'll privily away. I love the people,
[05:11.97]	But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
[05:15.44]	Through it do well, I do not relish well
[05:18.77]	Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
[05:21.95]	Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
[05:25.42]	That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
[05:29.03]ANGELO	The heavens give safety to your purposes!
[05:32.43]ESCALUS	Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
[05:35.98]DUKE	I thank you. Fare you well.
[05:38.29]	[Exit]
[05:39.16]ESCALUS	I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
[05:42.48]	To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
[05:46.39]	To look into the bottom of my place:
[05:49.42]	A power I have, but of what strength and nature
[05:53.26]	I am not yet instructed.
[05:55.43]ANGELO	'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
[05:58.75]	And we may soon our satisfaction have
[06:01.93]	Touching that point.
[06:03.81]ESCALUS	I'll wait upon your honour.
[06:06.20]	[Exeunt]
