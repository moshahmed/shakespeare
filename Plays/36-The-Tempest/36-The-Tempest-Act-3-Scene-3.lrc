[00:00.46]	[Another part of the island.,]
[00:01.38]	[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,
[00:01.84]	+ ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]
[00:02.30]GONZALO	By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
[00:05.45]	My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
[00:09.29]	Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
[00:13.67]	I needs must rest me.
[00:15.74]ALONSO	Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
[00:18.43]	Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
[00:21.81]	To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
[00:25.88]	Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
[00:29.80]	No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
[00:33.41]	Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
[00:37.33]	Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
[00:41.25]ANTONIO	[Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so
[00:44.39]	out of hope.
[00:45.78]	Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
[00:49.46]	That you resolved to effect.
[00:52.08]SEBASTIAN	[Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage
[00:54.46]	Will we take throughly.
[00:56.69]ANTONIO	[Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;
[00:59.07]	For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
[01:02.91]	Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
[01:06.36]	As when they are fresh.
[01:08.59]SEBASTIAN	[Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more.
[01:11.28]	[Solemn and strange music]
[01:12.20]ALONSO	What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
[01:15.89]GONZALO	Marvellous sweet music!
[01:18.12]	[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several
[01:18.58]	+ strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;
[01:19.04]	+ they dance about it with gentle actions of
[01:19.50]	+ salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to
[01:19.96]	+ eat, they depart]
[01:20.42]ALONSO	Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
[01:24.34]SEBASTIAN	A living drollery. Now I will believe
[01:27.64]	That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
[01:31.10]	There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
[01:35.32]	At this hour reigning there.
[01:37.94]ANTONIO	I'll believe both;
[01:39.78]	And what does else want credit, come to me,
[01:43.47]	And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
[01:47.61]	lie,
[01:48.38]	Though fools at home condemn 'em.
[01:51.30]GONZALO	If in Naples
[01:52.76]	I should report this now, would they believe me?
[01:56.83]	If I should say, I saw such islanders--
[02:00.14]	For, certes, these are people of the island--
[02:03.82]	Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
[02:07.97]	Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
[02:11.73]	Our human generation you shall find
[02:14.96]	Many, nay, almost any.
[02:16.96]PROSPERO	[Aside] Honest lord,
[02:18.80]	Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
[02:23.10]	Are worse than devils.
[02:25.25]ALONSO	I cannot too much muse
[02:27.48]	Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
[02:31.86]	Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
[02:35.70]	Of excellent dumb discourse.
[02:38.31]PROSPERO	[Aside]
[02:39.23]	Praise in departing.
[02:41.23]FRANCISCO	They vanish'd strangely.
[02:43.54]SEBASTIAN	No matter, since
[02:45.23]	They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
[02:49.99]	Will't please you taste of what is here?
[02:53.52]ALONSO	Not I.
[02:54.44]GONZALO	Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
[02:58.44]	Who would believe that there were mountaineers
[03:02.51]	Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
[03:07.12]	Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
[03:11.04]	Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
[03:15.57]	Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
[03:19.56]	Good warrant of.
[03:21.25]ALONSO	I will stand to and feed,
[03:23.63]	Although my last: no matter, since I feel
[03:27.17]	The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
[03:30.85]	Stand to and do as we.
[03:33.01]	[Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a
[03:33.47]	+ harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and,
[03:33.93]	+ with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]
[03:34.39]ARIEL	You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
[03:37.77]	That hath to instrument this lower world
[03:41.38]	And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
[03:44.99]	Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
[03:49.06]	Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
[03:52.75]	Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
[03:56.66]	And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
[04:00.97]	Their proper selves.
[04:02.96]	[ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &c. draw their swords]
[04:03.89]	You fools! I and my fellows
[04:06.42]	Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
[04:09.57]	Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
[04:13.49]	Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
[04:17.56]	Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
[04:21.25]	One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
[04:25.47]	Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
[04:29.00]	Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
[04:33.23]	And will not be uplifted. But remember--
[04:36.61]	For that's my business to you--that you three
[04:40.53]	From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
[04:43.91]	Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
[04:47.59]	Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
[04:51.66]	The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
[04:55.20]	Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
[04:59.58]	Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
[05:03.26]	They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
[05:06.80]	Lingering perdition, worse than any death
[05:10.41]	Can be at once, shall step by step attend
[05:14.02]	You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
[05:18.24]	Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
[05:22.47]	Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
[05:26.31]	And a clear life ensuing.
[05:28.69]	[He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music
[05:29.15]	+ enter the Shapes again, and dance, with
[05:29.61]	+ mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]
[05:30.07]PROSPERO	Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
[05:33.84]	Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
[05:37.68]	Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
[05:41.36]	In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
[05:45.21]	And observation strange, my meaner ministers
[05:49.05]	Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
[05:53.35]	And these mine enemies are all knit up
[05:56.80]	In their distractions; they now are in my power;
[06:00.88]	And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
[06:04.79]	Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
[06:08.71]	And his and mine loved darling.
[06:11.55]	[Exit above]
[06:12.48]GONZALO	I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
[06:16.55]	In this strange stare?
[06:18.70]ALONSO	O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
[06:21.31]	Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
[06:25.30]	The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
[06:29.14]	That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
[06:33.06]	The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
[06:36.90]	Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
[06:40.59]	I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
[06:44.66]	And with him there lie mudded.
[06:47.43]	[Exit]
[06:48.35]SEBASTIAN	But one fiend at a time,
[06:50.65]	I'll fight their legions o'er.
[06:53.42]ANTONIO	I'll be thy second.
[06:55.34]	[Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]
[06:56.26]GONZALO	All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
[07:00.56]	Like poison given to work a great time after,
[07:04.48]	Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
[07:08.47]	That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
[07:12.55]	And hinder them from what this ecstasy
[07:16.00]	May now provoke them to.
[07:18.31]ADRIAN	Follow, I pray you.
[07:20.15]	[Exeunt]
