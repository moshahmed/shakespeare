[00:00.52]	[Southwark.,]
[00:01.58]	[Alarum and retreat. Enter CADE and all his
[00:02.11]	+ rabblement]
[00:02.64]CADE	Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill
[00:07.13]	and knock down! throw them into Thames!
[00:11.01]	[Sound a parley]
[00:12.07]	What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold to
[00:16.92]	sound retreat or parley, when I command them kill?
[00:21.76]	[Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD, attended]
[00:22.82]BUCKINGHAM	Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee:
[00:27.58]	Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the king
[00:31.99]	Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;
[00:35.95]	And here pronounce free pardon to them all
[00:40.27]	That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
[00:44.68]CLIFFORD	What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,
[00:48.56]	And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you;
[00:52.79]	Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?
[00:56.75]	Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,
[01:01.42]	Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'
[01:06.01]	Who hateth him and honours not his father,
[01:10.24]	Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,
[01:14.82]	Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.
[01:18.70]ALL	God save the king! God save the king!
[01:22.40]CADE	What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave? And
[01:27.25]	you, base peasants, do ye believe him? will you
[01:31.74]	needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?
[01:36.77]	Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,
[01:41.79]	that you should leave me at the White Hart in
[01:46.37]	Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out
[01:51.31]	these arms till you had recovered your ancient
[01:55.98]	freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,
[02:00.65]	and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Let
[02:05.67]	them break your backs with burthens, take your
[02:10.26]	houses over your heads, ravish your wives and
[02:14.75]	daughters before your faces: for me, I will make
[02:19.42]	shift for one; and so, God's curse light upon you
[02:24.18]	all!
[02:25.06]ALL	We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!
[02:28.76]CLIFFORD	Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,
[02:32.38]	That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?
[02:36.78]	Will he conduct you through the heart of France,
[02:41.54]	And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?
[02:45.95]	Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to;
[02:50.00]	Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,
[02:54.24]	Unless by robbing of your friends and us.
[02:58.38]	Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,
[03:03.05]	The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,
[03:07.46]	Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?
[03:12.13]	Methinks already in this civil broil
[03:15.92]	I see them lording it in London streets,
[03:19.97]	Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.
[03:23.58]	Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry
[03:28.08]	Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.
[03:32.75]	To France, to France, and get what you have lost;
[03:37.42]	Spare England, for it is your native coast;
[03:41.65]	Henry hath money, you are strong and manly;
[03:45.88]	God on our side, doubt not of victory.
[03:49.67]ALL	A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.
[03:55.22]CADE	Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
[04:00.42]	multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them
[04:05.27]	to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me
[04:10.03]	desolate. I see them lay their heads together to
[04:14.79]	surprise me. My sword make way for me, for here is
[04:19.64]	no staying. In despite of the devils and hell, have
[04:24.57]	through the very middest of you? and heavens and
[04:29.33]	honour be witness, that no want of resolution in me.
[04:34.36]	but only my followers' base and ignominious
[04:38.67]	treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.
[04:42.73]	[Exit]
[04:43.79]BUCKINGHAM	What, is he fled? Go some, and follow him;
[04:47.75]	And he that brings his head unto the king
[04:51.98]	Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.
[04:56.39]	[Exeunt some of them]
[04:57.45]	Follow me, soldiers: we'll devise a mean
[05:01.41]	To reconcile you all unto the king.
[05:05.03]	[Exeunt]
