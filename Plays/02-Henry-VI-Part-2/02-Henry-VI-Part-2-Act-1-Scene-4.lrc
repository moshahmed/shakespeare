[00:00.44]	[GLOUCESTER's garden.,]
[00:01.33]	[Enter MARGARET JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWELL, and
[00:01.78]	+ BOLINGBROKE]
[00:02.22]HUME	Come, my masters; the duchess, I tell you, expects
[00:06.15]	performance of your promises.
[00:08.75]BOLINGBROKE	Master Hume, we are therefore provided: will her
[00:12.68]	ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?
[00:16.02]HUME	Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.
[00:19.28]BOLINGBROKE	I have heard her reported to be a woman of an
[00:23.14]	invincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,
[00:26.93]	Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we be
[00:31.01]	busy below; and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,
[00:34.86]	and leave us.
[00:36.27]	[Exit HUME]
[00:37.16]	Mother Jourdain, be you
[00:39.32]	prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,
[00:43.40]	read you; and let us to our work.
[00:46.22]	[Enter the DUCHESS aloft, HUME following]
[00:47.11]DUCHESS	Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this
[00:50.89]	gear the sooner the better.
[00:53.34]BOLINGBROKE	Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
[00:57.05]	Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
[01:00.91]	The time of night when Troy was set on fire;
[01:04.62]	The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
[01:08.70]	And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,
[01:12.85]	That time best fits the work we have in hand.
[01:16.63]	Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,
[01:20.12]	We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
[01:23.68]	[Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the
[01:24.13]	+ circle; BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads, Conjuro te,
[01:24.57]	+ &c. It thunders and lightens terribly; then the
[01:25.02]	+ Spirit riseth]
[01:25.46]Spirit	Adsum.
[01:26.35]MARGARET JOURDAIN	Asmath,
[01:27.32]	By the eternal God, whose name and power
[01:30.73]	Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
[01:34.29]	For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.
[01:38.52]Spirit	Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!
[01:42.23]BOLINGBROKE	'First of the king: what shall of him become?'
[01:45.87]	[Reading out of a paper]
[01:46.76]Spirit	The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
[01:50.39]	But him outlive, and die a violent death.
[01:53.80]	[As the Spirit speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer]
[01:54.69]BOLINGBROKE	'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
[01:57.88]Spirit	By water shall he die, and take his end.
[02:01.22]BOLINGBROKE	'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
[02:04.56]Spirit	Let him shun castles;
[02:06.56]	Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
[02:09.98]	Than where castles mounted stand.
[02:12.87]	Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
[02:16.21]BOLINGBROKE	Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
[02:19.70]	False fiend, avoid!
[02:21.48]	[Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit]
[02:22.37]	[Enter YORK and BUCKINGHAM with their Guard
[02:22.81]	+ and break in]
[02:23.26]YORK	Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
[02:27.12]	Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.
[02:30.60]	What, madam, are you there? the king and commonweal
[02:34.68]	Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:
[02:38.39]	My lord protector will, I doubt it not,
[02:41.66]	See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
[02:45.52]DUCHESS	Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
[02:49.15]	Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.
[02:53.08]BUCKINGHAM	True, madam, none at all: what call you this?
[02:56.64]	Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.
[03:00.35]	And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
[03:03.84]	Stafford, take her to thee.
[03:06.21]	[Exeunt above DUCHESS and HUME, guarded]
[03:07.10]	We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
[03:10.89]	All, away!
[03:12.00]	[Exeunt guard with MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, &c]
[03:12.89]YORK	Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:
[03:16.75]	A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
[03:20.16]	Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
[03:23.87]	What have we here?
[03:25.65]	[Reads]
[03:26.54]	'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;
[03:30.18]	But him outlive, and die a violent death.'
[03:33.59]	Why, this is just
[03:35.30]	'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'
[03:38.49]	Well, to the rest:
[03:40.19]	'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?
[03:43.98]	By water shall he die, and take his end.
[03:47.32]	What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
[03:50.65]	Let him shun castles;
[03:52.66]	Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
[03:56.07]	Than where castles mounted stand.'
[03:58.96]	Come, come, my lords;
[04:00.82]	These oracles are hardly attain'd,
[04:03.79]	And hardly understood.
[04:05.86]	The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,
[04:10.02]	With him the husband of this lovely lady:
[04:13.51]	Thither go these news, as fast as horse can
[04:17.14]	carry them:
[04:18.40]	A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.
[04:21.82]BUCKINGHAM	Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
[04:25.75]	To be the post, in hope of his reward.
[04:28.94]YORK	At your pleasure, my good lord. Who's within
[04:32.57]	there, ho!
[04:33.69]	[Enter a Servingman]
[04:34.58]	Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
[04:38.06]	To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!
[04:41.18]	[Exeunt]
