[00:00.31]	[Gloucester's castle.,]
[00:00.94]	[Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND]
[00:01.57]CORNWALL	I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
[00:04.30]EDMUND	How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
[00:07.09]	gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
[00:09.98]	of.
[00:10.45]CORNWALL	I now perceive, it was not altogether your
[00:12.97]	brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
[00:15.97]	but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
[00:18.86]	badness in himself.
[00:20.17]EDMUND	How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
[00:23.11]	be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
[00:25.79]	approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
[00:28.84]	of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
[00:31.63]	or not I the detector!
[00:33.10]CORNWALL	o with me to the duchess.
[00:34.73]EDMUND	If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
[00:37.56]	mighty business in hand.
[00:39.14]CORNWALL	True or false, it hath made thee earl of
[00:41.56]	Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
[00:44.39]	may be ready for our apprehension.
[00:46.50]EDMUND	[Aside] If I find him comforting the king, it will
[00:49.33]	stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
[00:52.33]	my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
[00:55.22]	between that and my blood.
[00:56.90]CORNWALL	I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
[00:59.79]	dearer father in my love.
[01:01.42]	[Exeunt]
