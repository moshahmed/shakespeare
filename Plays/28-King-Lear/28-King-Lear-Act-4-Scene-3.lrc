[00:00.38]	[The French camp near Dover.,]
[00:01.16]	[Enter KENT and a Gentleman]
[00:01.93]KENT	Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
[00:05.43]	know you the reason?
[00:07.11]Gentleman	Something he left imperfect in the
[00:09.76]	state, which since his coming forth is thought
[00:13.12]	of; which imports to the kingdom so much
[00:16.09]	fear and danger, that his personal return was
[00:19.39]	most required and necessary.
[00:21.59]KENT	Who hath he left behind him general?
[00:24.31]Gentleman	The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
[00:27.15]KENT	Did your letters pierce the queen to any
[00:30.19]	demonstration of grief?
[00:32.07]Gentleman	Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
[00:35.43]	And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
[00:38.66]	Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
[00:41.96]	Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
[00:44.74]	Sought to be king o'er her.
[00:46.87]KENT	O, then it moved her.
[00:48.55]Gentleman	Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
[00:51.59]	Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
[00:55.02]	Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
[00:58.45]	Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
[01:01.61]	That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
[01:05.04]	What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
[01:08.60]	As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
[01:11.64]	Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
[01:14.48]	If all could so become it.
[01:16.55]KENT	Made she no verbal question?
[01:18.75]Gentleman	'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
[01:22.37]	Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
[01:25.54]	Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
[01:28.90]	Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
[01:32.46]	Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
[01:35.50]	The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
[01:38.34]	And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
[01:41.57]	To deal with grief alone.
[01:43.58]KENT	It is the stars,
[01:45.00]	The stars above us, govern our conditions;
[01:48.04]	Else one self mate and mate could not beget
[01:51.27]	Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
[01:54.96]Gentleman	No.
[01:55.54]KENT	Was this before the king return'd?
[01:58.13]Gentleman	No, since.
[01:59.10]KENT	Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
[02:02.52]	Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
[02:05.63]	What we are come about, and by no means
[02:08.54]	Will yield to see his daughter.
[02:10.93]Gentleman	Why, good sir?
[02:12.16]KENT	A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
[02:15.84]	That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
[02:19.46]	To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
[02:22.63]	To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
[02:26.12]	His mind so venomously, that burning shame
[02:29.23]	Detains him from Cordelia.
[02:31.30]Gentleman	Alack, poor gentleman!
[02:33.04]KENT	Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
[02:36.53]Gentleman	'Tis so, they are afoot.
[02:38.34]KENT	Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
[02:41.51]	And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
[02:44.74]	Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
[02:47.59]	When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
[02:50.82]	Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
[02:53.99]	Along with me.
[02:55.28]	[Exeunt]
