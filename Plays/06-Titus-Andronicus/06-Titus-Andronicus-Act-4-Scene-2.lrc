[00:00.38]	[The same. A room in the palace.,]
[00:01.15]	[Enter, from one side, AARON, DEMETRIUS, and
[00:01.54]	+ CHIRON; from the other side, Young LUCIUS, and an
[00:01.93]	+ Attendant, with a bundle of weapons, and verses
[00:02.31]	+ writ upon them]
[00:02.70]CHIRON	Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
[00:05.34]	He hath some message to deliver us.
[00:07.99]AARON	Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
[00:11.27]Young LUCIUS	My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
[00:14.17]	I greet your honours from Andronicus.
[00:16.94]	[Aside]
[00:17.72]	And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
[00:20.81]DEMETRIUS	Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
[00:23.71]Young LUCIUS	[Aside] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
[00:27.38]	For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,
[00:30.86]	My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me
[00:33.95]	The goodliest weapons of his armoury
[00:36.72]	To gratify your honourable youth,
[00:39.24]	The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;
[00:42.14]	And so I do, and with his gifts present
[00:45.04]	Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
[00:48.19]	You may be armed and appointed well:
[00:50.90]	And so I leave you both:
[00:52.83]	[Aside]
[00:53.61]	like bloody villains.
[00:55.35]	[Exeunt Young LUCIUS, and Attendant]
[00:56.12]DEMETRIUS	What's here? A scroll; and written round about?
[00:59.41]	Let's see;
[01:00.44]	[Reads]
[01:01.21]	'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,
[01:03.66]	Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'
[01:06.11]CHIRON	O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
[01:09.01]	I read it in the grammar long ago.
[01:11.58]AARON	Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.
[01:14.81]	[Aside]
[01:15.58]	Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
[01:18.29]	Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;
[01:22.28]	And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,
[01:25.76]	That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
[01:29.05]	But were our witty empress well afoot,
[01:31.88]	She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
[01:34.65]	But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
[01:37.49]	And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
[01:40.65]	Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
[01:43.74]	Captives, to be advanced to this height?
[01:46.64]	It did me good, before the palace gate
[01:49.47]	To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
[01:52.82]DEMETRIUS	But me more good, to see so great a lord
[01:55.79]	Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
[01:58.43]AARON	Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
[02:00.94]	Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
[02:04.10]DEMETRIUS	I would we had a thousand Roman dames
[02:06.94]	At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.
[02:09.90]CHIRON	A charitable wish and full of love.
[02:12.54]AARON	Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
[02:15.70]CHIRON	And that would she for twenty thousand more.
[02:18.92]DEMETRIUS	Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods
[02:21.89]	For our beloved mother in her pains.
[02:24.59]AARON	[Aside] Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
[02:28.39]	[Trumpets sound within]
[02:29.17]DEMETRIUS	Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
[02:32.39]CHIRON	Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.
[02:35.22]DEMETRIUS	Soft! who comes here?
[02:36.90]	[Enter a Nurse, with a blackamoor Child in her arms]
[02:37.67]Nurse	Good morrow, lords:
[02:39.22]	O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
[02:41.99]AARON	Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
[02:45.02]	Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
[02:47.85]Nurse	O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
[02:50.37]	Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
[02:53.14]AARON	Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
[02:56.04]	What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
[02:59.32]Nurse	O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
[03:02.54]	Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!
[03:05.90]	She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.
[03:08.86]AARON	To whom?
[03:09.76]Nurse	I mean, she is brought a-bed.
[03:11.95]AARON	Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
[03:15.56]Nurse	A devil.
[03:16.46]AARON	Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.
[03:19.88]Nurse	A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:
[03:23.04]	Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
[03:26.00]	Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:
[03:29.09]	The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
[03:32.38]	And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
[03:35.99]AARON	'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?
[03:38.89]	Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.
[03:42.24]DEMETRIUS	Villain, what hast thou done?
[03:44.43]AARON	That which thou canst not undo.
[03:46.81]CHIRON	Thou hast undone our mother.
[03:49.00]AARON	Villain, I have done thy mother.
[03:51.39]DEMETRIUS	And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.
[03:54.42]	Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
[03:57.90]	Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
[04:00.99]CHIRON	It shall not live.
[04:02.54]AARON	It shall not die.
[04:04.02]Nurse	Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
[04:06.79]AARON	What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I
[04:09.82]	Do execution on my flesh and blood.
[04:12.46]DEMETRIUS	I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
[04:15.75]	Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.
[04:19.29]AARON	Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
[04:22.58]	[Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws]
[04:23.35]	Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
[04:27.02]	Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
[04:29.79]	That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
[04:33.08]	He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
[04:35.98]	That touches this my first-born son and heir!
[04:39.26]	I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
[04:41.97]	With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,
[04:45.45]	Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
[04:48.22]	Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
[04:51.70]	What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
[04:54.86]	Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
[04:58.27]	Coal-black is better than another hue,
[05:01.11]	In that it scorns to bear another hue;
[05:03.94]	For all the water in the ocean
[05:06.33]	Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
[05:09.68]	Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
[05:12.84]	Tell the empress from me, I am of age
[05:15.61]	To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.
[05:18.51]DEMETRIUS	Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
[05:21.54]AARON	My mistress is my mistress; this myself,
[05:24.43]	The vigour and the picture of my youth:
[05:27.33]	This before all the world do I prefer;
[05:30.17]	This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
[05:33.33]	Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
[05:36.42]DEMETRIUS	By this our mother is forever shamed.
[05:39.19]CHIRON	Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
[05:42.35]Nurse	The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.
[05:45.57]CHIRON	I blush to think upon this ignomy.
[05:48.15]AARON	Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
[05:51.37]	Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
[05:55.04]	The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
[05:58.20]	Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
[06:01.29]	Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,
[06:04.77]	As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
[06:07.80]	He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
[06:10.64]	Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,
[06:14.05]	And from that womb where you imprison'd were
[06:17.34]	He is enfranchised and come to light:
[06:20.11]	Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
[06:23.14]	Although my seal be stamped in his face.
[06:26.10]Nurse	Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?
[06:29.07]DEMETRIUS	Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
[06:31.84]	And we will all subscribe to thy advice:
[06:34.80]	Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.
[06:37.89]AARON	Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
[06:40.86]	My son and I will have the wind of you:
[06:43.76]	Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.
[06:47.17]	[They sit]
[06:47.95]DEMETRIUS	How many women saw this child of his?
[06:50.72]AARON	Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,
[06:53.81]	I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
[06:56.64]	The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
[06:59.41]	The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
[07:02.38]	But say, again; how many saw the child?
[07:05.15]Nurse	Cornelia the midwife and myself;
[07:07.60]	And no one else but the deliver'd empress.
[07:10.69]AARON	The empress, the midwife, and yourself:
[07:13.46]	Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
[07:16.62]	Go to the empress, tell her this I said.
[07:19.52]	[He kills the nurse]
[07:20.29]	Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.
[07:23.64]DEMETRIUS	What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?
[07:27.25]AARON	O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:
[07:29.70]	Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
[07:32.92]	A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:
[07:36.08]	And now be it known to you my full intent.
[07:39.17]	Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;
[07:41.94]	His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
[07:45.17]	His child is like to her, fair as you are:
[07:48.19]	Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
[07:51.29]	And tell them both the circumstance of all;
[07:54.44]	And how by this their child shall be advanced,
[07:57.79]	And be received for the emperor's heir,
[08:00.69]	And substituted in the place of mine,
[08:03.47]	To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
[08:06.62]	And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
[08:09.78]	Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,
[08:13.07]	[Pointing to the nurse]
[08:13.84]	And you must needs bestow her funeral;
[08:16.67]	The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:
[08:20.09]	This done, see that you take no longer days,
[08:23.25]	But send the midwife presently to me.
[08:26.02]	The midwife and the nurse well made away,
[08:29.05]	Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
[08:32.27]CHIRON	Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
[08:35.23]	With secrets.
[08:36.46]DEMETRIUS	For this care of Tamora,
[08:38.39]	Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
[08:41.48]	[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the
[08:41.87]	+ Nurse's body]
[08:42.26]AARON	Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;
[08:45.41]	There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
[08:48.64]	And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
[08:51.73]	Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
[08:55.40]	For it is you that puts us to our shifts:
[08:58.43]	I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
[09:01.59]	And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
[09:04.87]	And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
[09:07.64]	To be a warrior, and command a camp.
[09:10.29]	[Exit]
