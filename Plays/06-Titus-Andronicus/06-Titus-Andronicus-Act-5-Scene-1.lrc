[00:00.39]	[Plains near Rome.,]
[00:01.19]	[Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours]
[00:01.99]LUCIUS	Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
[00:05.18]	I have received letters from great Rome,
[00:08.24]	Which signify what hate they bear their emperor
[00:11.82]	And how desirous of our sight they are.
[00:14.81]	Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
[00:18.40]	Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,
[00:21.39]	And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
[00:24.52]	Let him make treble satisfaction.
[00:27.11]First Goth	Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
[00:30.43]	Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;
[00:33.95]	Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
[00:37.08]	Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
[00:40.40]	Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,
[00:43.86]	Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
[00:47.11]	Led by their master to the flowered fields,
[00:50.37]	And be avenged on cursed Tamora.
[00:52.89]All the Goths	And as he saith, so say we all with him.
[00:55.88]LUCIUS	I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
[00:58.88]	But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
[01:01.87]	[Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms]
[01:02.66]Second Goth	Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
[01:05.85]	To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
[01:08.44]	And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye
[01:11.24]	Upon the wasted building, suddenly
[01:13.89]	I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
[01:16.82]	I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
[01:19.88]	The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
[01:23.40]	'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
[01:26.65]	Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
[01:29.91]	Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
[01:33.17]	Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
[01:36.36]	But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
[01:39.88]	They never do beget a coal-black calf.
[01:42.80]	Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates
[01:45.79]	the babe,--
[01:46.79]	'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
[01:49.71]	Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,
[01:53.04]	Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
[01:56.36]	With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
[01:59.68]	Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,
[02:03.14]	To use as you think needful of the man.
[02:06.13]LUCIUS	O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
[02:09.32]	That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
[02:12.38]	This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,
[02:15.96]	And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
[02:19.42]	Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
[02:23.01]	This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
[02:26.20]	Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?
[02:29.26]	A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.
[02:32.31]	And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
[02:35.24]AARON	Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
[02:38.23]LUCIUS	Too like the sire for ever being good.
[02:41.15]	First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
[02:44.67]	A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
[02:47.73]	Get me a ladder.
[02:49.19]	[A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend]
[02:49.99]AARON	Lucius, save the child,
[02:51.85]	And bear it from me to the empress.
[02:54.58]	If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
[02:58.10]	That highly may advantage thee to hear:
[03:01.09]	If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
[03:04.14]	I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
[03:07.53]LUCIUS	Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
[03:10.99]	Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
[03:14.64]AARON	An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
[03:17.97]	'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
[03:21.42]	For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
[03:24.95]	Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
[03:27.80]	Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
[03:30.79]	Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:
[03:33.85]	And this shall all be buried by my death,
[03:36.97]	Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
[03:40.30]LUCIUS	Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
[03:43.62]AARON	Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
[03:46.81]LUCIUS	Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
[03:50.13]	That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
[03:53.46]AARON	What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
[03:56.25]	Yet, for I know thou art religious
[03:58.90]	And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
[04:02.43]	With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
[04:05.55]	Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
[04:08.74]	Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
[04:11.93]	An idiot holds his bauble for a god
[04:14.72]	And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
[04:18.24]	To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
[04:21.77]	By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
[04:24.76]	That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
[04:27.81]	To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
[04:31.07]	Or else I will discover nought to thee.
[04:34.06]LUCIUS	Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
[04:36.98]AARON	First know thou, I begot him on the empress.
[04:40.24]LUCIUS	O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
[04:43.10]AARON	Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
[04:46.29]	To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
[04:49.41]	'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
[04:52.60]	They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
[04:56.06]	And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
[04:59.71]LUCIUS	O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
[05:03.30]AARON	Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas
[05:06.89]	Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
[05:10.28]LUCIUS	O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
[05:13.47]AARON	Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
[05:16.66]	That codding spirit had they from their mother,
[05:20.18]	As sure a card as ever won the set;
[05:22.91]	That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
[05:26.23]	As true a dog as ever fought at head.
[05:29.09]	Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
[05:32.21]	I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
[05:35.60]	Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
[05:38.59]	I wrote the letter that thy father found
[05:41.71]	And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
[05:45.10]	Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
[05:48.42]	And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
[05:51.88]	Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
[05:55.07]	I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
[05:58.33]	And, when I had it, drew myself apart
[06:01.12]	And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
[06:04.71]	I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
[06:07.83]	When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
[06:11.15]	Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
[06:14.28]	That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
[06:17.53]	And when I told the empress of this sport,
[06:20.72]	She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
[06:23.71]	And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
[06:26.84]First Goth	What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?
[06:30.23]AARON	Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
[06:33.08]LUCIUS	Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
[06:36.34]AARON	Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
[06:39.33]	Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
[06:42.45]	Few come within the compass of my curse,--
[06:45.51]	Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
[06:48.37]	As kill a man, or else devise his death,
[06:51.36]	Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
[06:54.35]	Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
[06:57.47]	Set deadly enmity between two friends,
[07:00.40]	Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
[07:03.52]	Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
[07:06.98]	And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
[07:10.56]	Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
[07:14.15]	And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
[07:17.81]	Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
[07:21.06]	And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
[07:24.32]	Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
[07:27.58]	'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
[07:30.70]	Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
[07:33.96]	As willingly as one would kill a fly,
[07:36.81]	And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
[07:39.80]	But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
[07:42.80]LUCIUS	Bring down the devil; for he must not die
[07:45.92]	So sweet a death as hanging presently.
[07:48.84]AARON	If there be devils, would I were a devil,
[07:51.90]	To live and burn in everlasting fire,
[07:54.76]	So I might have your company in hell,
[07:57.61]	But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
[08:00.74]LUCIUS	Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
[08:04.19]	[Enter a Goth]
[08:04.99]Third Goth	My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
[08:07.98]	Desires to be admitted to your presence.
[08:11.04]LUCIUS	Let him come near.
[08:12.63]	[Enter AEMILIUS]
[08:13.43]	Welcome, AEmilius
[08:14.96]	what's the news from Rome?
[08:17.09]AEMILIUS	Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
[08:20.21]	The Roman emperor greets you all by me;
[08:23.20]	And, for he understands you are in arms,
[08:26.19]	He craves a parley at your father's house,
[08:29.38]	Willing you to demand your hostages,
[08:32.17]	And they shall be immediately deliver'd.
[08:35.23]First Goth	What says our general?
[08:37.09]LUCIUS	AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges
[08:40.28]	Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
[08:43.00]	And we will come. March away.
[08:45.26]	[Exeunt]
