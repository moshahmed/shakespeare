[00:00.40]	[Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS]
[00:01.20]AARON	Come on, my lords, the better foot before:
[00:04.26]	Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
[00:07.80]	Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
[00:10.80]QUINTUS	My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
[00:13.87]MARTIUS	And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,
[00:17.20]	Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
[00:20.60]	[Falls into the pit]
[00:21.40]QUINTUS	What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,
[00:24.87]	Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,
[00:28.47]	Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
[00:31.94]	As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
[00:35.34]	A very fatal place it seems to me.
[00:38.01]	Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
[00:41.61]MARTIUS	O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt
[00:44.81]	That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
[00:48.08]AARON	[Aside] Now will I fetch the king to find them here,
[00:51.81]	That he thereby may give a likely guess
[00:54.88]	How these were they that made away his brother.
[00:58.42]	[Exit]
[00:59.22]MARTIUS	Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
[01:02.28]	From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
[01:05.62]QUINTUS	I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
[01:08.42]	A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:
[01:11.95]	My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
[01:15.36]MARTIUS	To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
[01:18.49]	Aaron and thou look down into this den,
[01:21.49]	And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
[01:24.76]QUINTUS	Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart
[01:27.89]	Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
[01:31.03]	The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
[01:34.16]	O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now
[01:37.16]	Was I a child to fear I know not what.
[01:40.10]MARTIUS	Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,
[01:42.77]	All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,
[01:45.90]	In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
[01:49.03]QUINTUS	If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
[01:52.10]MARTIUS	Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
[01:54.90]	A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,
[01:58.17]	Which, like a taper in some monument,
[02:00.97]	Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
[02:04.37]	And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
[02:07.51]	So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
[02:10.44]	When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
[02:13.78]	O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--
[02:16.91]	If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--
[02:20.18]	Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
[02:23.11]	As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
[02:25.78]QUINTUS	Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
[02:29.05]	Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
[02:32.38]	I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
[02:35.58]	Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
[02:38.52]	I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
[02:41.99]MARTIUS	Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
[02:45.32]QUINTUS	Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
[02:48.52]	Till thou art here aloft, or I below:
[02:51.32]	Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
[02:54.46]	[Falls in]
[02:55.26]	[Enter SATURNINUS with AARON]
[02:56.06]SATURNINUS	Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,
[02:59.19]	And what he is that now is leap'd into it.
[03:02.39]	Say who art thou that lately didst descend
[03:05.66]	Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
[03:08.53]MARTIUS	The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
[03:11.20]	Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
[03:14.13]	To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
[03:16.87]SATURNINUS	My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
[03:20.07]	He and his lady both are at the lodge
[03:23.00]	Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
[03:26.27]	'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
[03:29.27]MARTIUS	We know not where you left him all alive;
[03:32.41]	But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.
[03:35.54]	[Re-enter TAMORA, with Attendants; TITUS
[03:35.94]	+ ANDRONICUS, and Lucius]
[03:36.34]TAMORA	Where is my lord the king?
[03:38.47]SATURNINUS	Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.
[03:41.94]TAMORA	Where is thy brother Bassianus?
[03:44.41]SATURNINUS	Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
[03:47.74]	Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
[03:50.41]TAMORA	Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
[03:53.61]	The complot of this timeless tragedy;
[03:56.48]	And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
[03:59.82]	In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
[04:03.02]	[She giveth SATURNINUS a letter]
[04:03.82]SATURNINUS	[Reads] 'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--
[04:07.08]	Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--
[04:09.95]	Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
[04:13.09]	Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
[04:16.49]	Among the nettles at the elder-tree
[04:19.29]	Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
[04:22.62]	Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
[04:25.36]	Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
[04:28.69]	O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
[04:31.29]	This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
[04:34.36]	Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
[04:37.63]	That should have murdered Bassianus here.
[04:40.76]AARON	My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
[04:43.90]SATURNINUS	[To TITUS] Two of thy whelps, fell curs of
[04:46.77]	bloody kind,
[04:47.97]	Have here bereft my brother of his life.
[04:51.03]	Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:
[04:54.37]	There let them bide until we have devised
[04:57.57]	Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
[05:00.90]TAMORA	What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
[05:04.17]	How easily murder is discovered!
[05:06.71]TITUS ANDRONICUS	High emperor, upon my feeble knee
[05:09.31]	I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
[05:12.64]	That this fell fault of my accursed sons,
[05:15.78]	Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--
[05:18.84]SATURNINUS	If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
[05:21.85]	Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
[05:24.91]TAMORA	Andronicus himself did take it up.
[05:27.58]TITUS ANDRONICUS	I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
[05:30.58]	For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow
[05:33.58]	They shall be ready at your highness' will
[05:36.78]	To answer their suspicion with their lives.
[05:40.05]SATURNINUS	Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
[05:43.39]	Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:
[05:46.99]	Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
[05:50.39]	For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
[05:53.92]	That end upon them should be executed.
[05:56.86]TAMORA	Andronicus, I will entreat the king;
[05:59.59]	Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.
[06:02.93]TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.
[06:06.26]	[Exeunt]
