[00:00.35]	[Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.,]
[00:01.06]	[Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown]
[00:01.77]LAFEU	No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
[00:05.08]	fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
[00:08.27]	made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
[00:11.76]	his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
[00:15.07]	this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
[00:18.39]	by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
[00:22.17]COUNTESS	I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
[00:25.60]	most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
[00:28.73]	praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
[00:31.81]	flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
[00:35.18]	could not have owed her a more rooted love.
[00:38.08]LAFEU	'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
[00:41.27]	thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.
[00:44.58]Clown	Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
[00:47.60]	salad, or rather, the herb of grace.
[00:49.96]LAFEU	They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
[00:53.21]Clown	I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
[00:56.47]	skill in grass.
[00:57.71]LAFEU	Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?
[01:01.14]Clown	A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
[01:04.75]LAFEU	Your distinction?
[01:06.11]Clown	I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.
[01:09.59]LAFEU	So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
[01:12.43]Clown	And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
[01:16.22]LAFEU	I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.
[01:19.82]Clown	At your service.
[01:21.13]LAFEU	No, no, no.
[01:22.01]Clown	Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
[01:25.03]	great a prince as you are.
[01:26.92]LAFEU	Who's that? a Frenchman?
[01:28.64]Clown	Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
[01:31.83]	is more hotter in France than there.
[01:34.31]LAFEU	What prince is that?
[01:35.85]Clown	The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
[01:38.63]	darkness; alias, the devil.
[01:40.46]LAFEU	Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
[01:43.66]	to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
[01:46.85]	serve him still.
[01:48.15]Clown	I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
[01:51.28]	great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
[01:54.59]	good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
[01:57.49]	world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
[02:00.80]	the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
[02:04.12]	too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
[02:07.19]	themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
[02:10.50]	tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
[02:13.64]	leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
[02:16.53]LAFEU	Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
[02:19.67]	tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
[02:22.92]	with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
[02:25.88]	looked to, without any tricks.
[02:27.95]Clown	If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
[02:31.02]	jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.
[02:34.92]	[Exit]
[02:35.63]LAFEU	A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
[02:37.76]COUNTESS	So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
[02:40.90]	sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
[02:44.21]	which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
[02:47.52]	indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.
[02:50.53]LAFEU	I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
[02:53.79]	tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
[02:57.22]	that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
[03:00.47]	moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
[03:03.84]	my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
[03:06.97]	his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
[03:10.34]	first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
[03:13.66]	it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
[03:16.49]	conceived against your son, there is no fitter
[03:19.57]	matter. How does your ladyship like it?
[03:22.17]COUNTESS	With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
[03:25.19]	happily effected.
[03:26.55]LAFEU	His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
[03:29.92]	body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
[03:33.11]	to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
[03:36.24]	intelligence hath seldom failed.
[03:38.49]COUNTESS	It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
[03:41.74]	die. I have letters that my son will be here
[03:44.70]	to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
[03:47.95]	with me till they meet together.
[03:50.20]LAFEU	Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
[03:53.33]	safely be admitted.
[03:54.81]COUNTESS	You need but plead your honourable privilege.
[03:57.83]LAFEU	Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
[04:00.90]	thank my God it holds yet.
[04:02.80]	[Re-enter Clown]
[04:03.50]Clown	O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
[04:06.82]	velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
[04:10.07]	or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
[04:13.32]	velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
[04:16.69]	half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
[04:19.29]LAFEU	A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
[04:22.60]	of honour; so belike is that.
[04:24.62]Clown	But it is your carbonadoed face.
[04:26.86]LAFEU	Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
[04:30.11]	with the young noble soldier.
[04:32.18]Clown	Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
[04:35.32]	hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
[04:38.75]	and nod at every man.
[04:40.34]	[Exeunt]
