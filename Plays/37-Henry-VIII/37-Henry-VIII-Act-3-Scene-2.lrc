[00:00.39]	[Ante-chamber to KING HENRY VIII's apartment.,]
[00:01.18]	[Enter NORFOLK, SUFFOLK, SURREY, and Chamberlain]
[00:01.96]NORFOLK	If you will now unite in your complaints,
[00:05.05]	And force them with a constancy, the cardinal
[00:08.40]	Cannot stand under them: if you omit
[00:11.15]	The offer of this time, I cannot promise
[00:14.17]	But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,
[00:17.52]	With these you bear already.
[00:19.75]SURREY	I am joyful
[00:20.93]	To meet the least occasion that may give me
[00:24.21]	Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,
[00:27.30]	To be revenged on him.
[00:29.13]SUFFOLK	Which of the peers
[00:30.77]	Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
[00:33.86]	Strangely neglected? when did he regard
[00:36.81]	The stamp of nobleness in any person
[00:39.63]	Out of himself?
[00:41.01]Chamberlain	My lords, you speak your pleasures:
[00:43.64]	What he deserves of you and me I know;
[00:46.52]	What we can do to him, though now the time
[00:49.67]	Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot
[00:52.82]	Bar his access to the king, never attempt
[00:55.91]	Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft
[00:59.06]	Over the king in's tongue.
[01:01.16]NORFOLK	O, fear him not;
[01:02.54]	His spell in that is out: the king hath found
[01:05.88]	Matter against him that for ever mars
[01:08.77]	The honey of his language. No, he's settled,
[01:11.92]	Not to come off, in his displeasure.
[01:14.61]SURREY	Sir,
[01:15.27]	I should be glad to hear such news as this
[01:18.48]	Once every hour.
[01:19.93]NORFOLK	Believe it, this is true:
[01:21.90]	In the divorce his contrary proceedings
[01:24.92]	Are all unfolded wherein he appears
[01:27.67]	As I would wish mine enemy.
[01:29.84]SURREY	How came
[01:30.82]	His practises to light?
[01:32.72]SUFFOLK	Most strangely.
[01:34.10]SURREY	O, how, how?
[01:35.15]SUFFOLK	The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,
[01:38.57]	And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,
[01:42.11]	How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
[01:45.59]	To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if
[01:48.74]	It did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive
[01:51.82]	My king is tangled in affection to
[01:54.51]	A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
[01:57.73]SURREY	Has the king this?
[01:59.30]SUFFOLK	Believe it.
[02:00.42]SURREY	Will this work?
[02:01.80]Chamberlain	The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
[02:05.14]	And hedges his own way. But in this point
[02:08.23]	All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
[02:11.77]	After his patient's death: the king already
[02:14.99]	Hath married the fair lady.
[02:17.15]SURREY	Would he had!
[02:18.40]SUFFOLK	May you be happy in your wish, my lord
[02:21.29]	For, I profess, you have it.
[02:23.39]SURREY	Now, all my joy
[02:24.77]	Trace the conjunction!
[02:26.60]SUFFOLK	My amen to't!
[02:27.85]NORFOLK	All men's!
[02:28.90]SUFFOLK	There's order given for her coronation:
[02:31.85]	Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left
[02:35.14]	To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
[02:38.02]	She is a gallant creature, and complete
[02:40.98]	In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her
[02:44.19]	Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall
[02:47.80]	In it be memorised.
[02:49.44]SURREY	But, will the king
[02:51.02]	Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
[02:53.84]	The Lord forbid!
[02:55.28]NORFOLK	Marry, amen!
[02:56.40]SUFFOLK	No, no;
[02:57.19]	There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
[03:00.47]	Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
[03:04.14]	Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;
[03:07.36]	Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and
[03:10.64]	Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,
[03:13.59]	To second all his plot. I do assure you
[03:16.55]	The king cried Ha! at this.
[03:18.65]Chamberlain	Now, God incense him,
[03:20.35]	And let him cry Ha! louder!
[03:22.45]NORFOLK	But, my lord,
[03:23.63]	When returns Cranmer?
[03:25.41]SUFFOLK	He is return'd in his opinions; which
[03:28.23]	Have satisfied the king for his divorce,
[03:31.25]	Together with all famous colleges
[03:33.87]	Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,
[03:36.89]	His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
[03:40.11]	Her coronation. Katharine no more
[03:42.66]	Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager
[03:45.88]	And widow to Prince Arthur.
[03:48.05]NORFOLK	This same Cranmer's
[03:49.75]	A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
[03:52.84]	In the king's business.
[03:54.74]SUFFOLK	He has; and we shall see him
[03:56.97]	For it an archbishop.
[03:58.74]NORFOLK	So I hear.
[03:59.79]SUFFOLK	'Tis so.
[04:00.65]	The cardinal!
[04:01.89]	[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL]
[04:02.68]NORFOLK	Observe, observe, he's moody.
[04:04.85]CARDINAL WOLSEY	The packet, Cromwell.
[04:06.55]	Gave't you the king?
[04:08.26]CROMWELL	To his own hand, in's bedchamber.
[04:10.75]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?
[04:13.51]CROMWELL	Presently
[04:14.56]	He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,
[04:17.77]	He did it with a serious mind; a heed
[04:20.60]	Was in his countenance. You he bade
[04:23.29]	Attend him here this morning.
[04:25.58]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Is he ready
[04:26.77]	To come abroad?
[04:28.14]CROMWELL	I think, by this he is.
[04:29.98]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Leave me awhile.
[04:31.43]	[Exit CROMWELL]
[04:32.21]	[Aside]
[04:33.00]	It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,
[04:35.89]	The French king's sister: he shall marry her.
[04:39.17]	Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:
[04:42.45]	There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!
[04:45.60]	No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish
[04:48.36]	To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
[04:51.77]NORFOLK	He's discontented.
[04:53.34]SUFFOLK	May be, he hears the king
[04:55.38]	Does whet his anger to him.
[04:57.54]SURREY	Sharp enough,
[04:58.79]	Lord, for thy justice!
[05:00.56]CARDINAL WOLSEY	[Aside] The late queen's gentlewoman,
[05:03.25]	a knight's daughter,
[05:04.96]	To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!
[05:08.37]	This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;
[05:11.92]	Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
[05:15.53]	And well deserving? yet I know her for
[05:18.41]	A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
[05:21.43]	Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of
[05:24.78]	Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up
[05:28.13]	An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one
[05:30.82]	Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,
[05:33.90]	And is his oracle.
[05:35.48]NORFOLK	He is vex'd at something.
[05:37.51]SURREY	I would 'twere something that would fret the string,
[05:41.25]	The master-cord on's heart!
[05:43.42]	[Enter KING HENRY VIII, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL]
[05:44.20]SUFFOLK	The king, the king!
[05:45.78]KING HENRY VIII	What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
[05:48.86]	To his own portion! and what expense by the hour
[05:52.41]	Seems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,
[05:55.95]	Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
[05:58.97]	Saw you the cardinal?
[06:00.74]NORFOLK	My lord, we have
[06:02.19]	Stood here observing him: some strange commotion
[06:05.73]	Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;
[06:09.01]	Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
[06:12.03]	Then lays his finger on his temple, straight
[06:15.31]	Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,
[06:18.59]	Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts
[06:21.74]	His eye against the moon: in most strange postures
[06:25.42]	We have seen him set himself.
[06:27.71]KING HENRY VIII	It may well be;
[06:29.09]	There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning
[06:32.18]	Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
[06:35.00]	As I required: and wot you what I found
[06:37.95]	There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?
[06:40.91]	Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;
[06:43.73]	The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
[06:47.14]	Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
[06:50.49]	I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks
[06:53.83]	Possession of a subject.
[06:55.80]NORFOLK	It's heaven's will:
[06:57.44]	Some spirit put this paper in the packet,
[07:00.53]	To bless your eye withal.
[07:02.56]KING HENRY VIII	If we did think
[07:04.01]	His contemplation were above the earth,
[07:06.96]	And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still
[07:10.37]	Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
[07:13.19]	His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
[07:16.41]	His serious considering.
[07:18.38]	[King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL,
[07:18.77]	+ who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY]
[07:19.17]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Heaven forgive me!
[07:20.74]	Ever God bless your highness!
[07:23.04]KING HENRY VIII	Good my lord,
[07:24.28]	You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
[07:28.22]	Of your best graces in your mind; the which
[07:31.44]	You were now running o'er: you have scarce time
[07:34.92]	To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
[07:38.26]	To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that
[07:41.28]	I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
[07:44.17]	To have you therein my companion.
[07:46.73]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Sir,
[07:47.39]	For holy offices I have a time; a time
[07:50.27]	To think upon the part of business which
[07:53.36]	I bear i' the state; and nature does require
[07:56.57]	Her times of preservation, which perforce
[07:59.66]	I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
[08:02.87]	Must give my tendence to.
[08:04.91]KING HENRY VIII	You have said well.
[08:06.55]CARDINAL WOLSEY	And ever may your highness yoke together,
[08:09.63]	As I will lend you cause, my doing well
[08:12.59]	With my well saying!
[08:14.29]KING HENRY VIII	'Tis well said again;
[08:16.00]	And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:
[08:19.02]	And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:
[08:22.50]	His said he did; and with his deed did crown
[08:25.78]	His word upon you. Since I had my office,
[08:28.80]	I have kept you next my heart; have not alone
[08:32.14]	Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
[08:35.69]	But pared my present havings, to bestow
[08:38.64]	My bounties upon you.
[08:40.41]CARDINAL WOLSEY	[Aside] What should this mean?
[08:42.64]SURREY	[Aside] The Lord increase this business!
[08:45.53]KING HENRY VIII	Have I not made you,
[08:47.24]	The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,
[08:50.65]	If what I now pronounce you have found true:
[08:53.93]	And, if you may confess it, say withal,
[08:56.75]	If you are bound to us or no. What say you?
[08:59.90]CARDINAL WOLSEY	My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
[09:02.99]	Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could
[09:06.46]	My studied purposes requite; which went
[09:09.42]	Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours
[09:12.57]	Have ever come too short of my desires,
[09:15.52]	Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends
[09:18.67]	Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
[09:22.02]	To the good of your most sacred person and
[09:25.23]	The profit of the state. For your great graces
[09:28.65]	Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I
[09:31.21]	Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,
[09:34.22]	My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,
[09:37.24]	Which ever has and ever shall be growing,
[09:40.33]	Till death, that winter, kill it.
[09:42.76]KING HENRY VIII	Fairly answer'd;
[09:44.20]	A loyal and obedient subject is
[09:46.69]	Therein illustrated: the honour of it
[09:49.52]	Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,
[09:52.60]	The foulness is the punishment. I presume
[09:55.68]	That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,
[09:58.77]	My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more
[10:02.44]	On you than any; so your hand and heart,
[10:05.40]	Your brain, and every function of your power,
[10:08.68]	Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
[10:12.09]	As 'twere in love's particular, be more
[10:14.98]	To me, your friend, than any.
[10:17.14]CARDINAL WOLSEY	I do profess
[10:18.39]	That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
[10:21.67]	More than mine own; that am, have, and will be--
[10:24.95]	Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
[10:28.76]	And throw it from their soul; though perils did
[10:32.24]	Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and
[10:35.59]	Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,
[10:38.60]	As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
[10:41.69]	Should the approach of this wild river break,
[10:45.04]	And stand unshaken yours.
[10:47.07]KING HENRY VIII	'Tis nobly spoken:
[10:48.58]	Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
[10:51.60]	For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;
[10:54.88]	[Giving him papers]
[10:55.67]	And after, this: and then to breakfast with
[10:58.82]	What appetite you have.
[11:00.72]	[Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY:
[11:01.11]	+ the Nobles throng after him, smiling and whispering]
[11:01.51]CARDINAL WOLSEY	What should this mean?
[11:03.34]	What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
[11:06.76]	He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
[11:09.65]	Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion
[11:13.06]	Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;
[11:16.40]	Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
[11:19.82]	I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
[11:22.64]	This paper has undone me: 'tis the account
[11:25.72]	Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
[11:29.40]	For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,
[11:32.75]	And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!
[11:35.76]	Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
[11:38.98]	Made me put this main secret in the packet
[11:42.20]	I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
[11:45.54]	No new device to beat this from his brains?
[11:48.76]	I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
[11:51.91]	A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
[11:55.12]	Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'
[11:58.67]	The letter, as I live, with all the business
[12:01.88]	I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!
[12:04.84]	I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;
[12:08.71]	And, from that full meridian of my glory,
[12:11.73]	I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
[12:14.68]	Like a bright exhalation m the evening,
[12:17.63]	And no man see me more.
[12:19.54]	[Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, SURREY,
[12:19.93]	+ and the Chamberlain]
[12:20.32]NORFOLK	Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you
[12:24.07]	To render up the great seal presently
[12:26.95]	Into our hands; and to confine yourself
[12:29.91]	To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,
[12:32.86]	Till you hear further from his highness.
[12:35.88]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Stay:
[12:36.60]	Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry
[12:40.21]	Authority so weighty.
[12:41.98]SUFFOLK	Who dare cross 'em,
[12:43.56]	Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?
[12:47.17]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Till I find more than will or words to do it,
[12:50.51]	I mean your malice, know, officious lords,
[12:53.53]	I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
[12:56.22]	Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:
[12:59.31]	How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,
[13:02.00]	As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton
[13:05.08]	Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
[13:08.30]	Follow your envious courses, men of malice;
[13:11.45]	You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,
[13:14.93]	In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,
[13:18.34]	You ask with such a violence, the king,
[13:21.23]	Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;
[13:24.70]	Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,
[13:27.99]	During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,
[13:31.20]	Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?
[13:34.61]SURREY	The king, that gave it.
[13:36.45]CARDINAL WOLSEY	It must be himself, then.
[13:38.42]SURREY	Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
[13:40.91]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Proud lord, thou liest:
[13:42.75]	Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
[13:46.10]	Have burnt that tongue than said so.
[13:48.85]SURREY	Thy ambition,
[13:50.10]	Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land
[13:53.38]	Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:
[13:56.20]	The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
[13:59.16]	With thee and all thy best parts bound together,
[14:02.70]	Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
[14:06.25]	You sent me deputy for Ireland;
[14:08.67]	Far from his succor, from the king, from all
[14:11.89]	That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;
[14:15.63]	Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
[14:18.91]	Absolved him with an axe.
[14:20.95]CARDINAL WOLSEY	This, and all else
[14:22.52]	This talking lord can lay upon my credit,
[14:25.61]	I answer is most false. The duke by law
[14:28.56]	Found his deserts: how innocent I was
[14:31.38]	From any private malice in his end,
[14:34.07]	His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
[14:37.22]	If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you
[14:40.57]	You have as little honesty as honour,
[14:43.39]	That in the way of loyalty and truth
[14:46.21]	Toward the king, my ever royal master,
[14:49.03]	Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,
[14:52.25]	And all that love his follies.
[14:54.61]SURREY	By my soul,
[14:55.73]	Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou
[14:58.75]	shouldst feel
[15:00.06]	My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,
[15:03.60]	Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
[15:06.42]	And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,
[15:09.71]	To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,
[15:12.66]	Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,
[15:15.87]	And dare us with his cap like larks.
[15:18.63]CARDINAL WOLSEY	All goodness
[15:19.88]	Is poison to thy stomach.
[15:21.91]SURREY	Yes, that goodness
[15:23.49]	Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,
[15:26.70]	Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;
[15:29.85]	The goodness of your intercepted packets
[15:32.94]	You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,
[15:36.74]	Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.
[15:40.09]	My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
[15:43.24]	As you respect the common good, the state
[15:46.33]	Of our despised nobility, our issues,
[15:49.08]	Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,
[15:52.10]	Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
[15:55.58]	Collected from his life. I'll startle you
[15:58.66]	Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench
[16:02.27]	Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.
[16:05.23]CARDINAL WOLSEY	How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
[16:08.44]	But that I am bound in charity against it!
[16:11.59]NORFOLK	Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:
[16:15.00]	But, thus much, they are foul ones.
[16:17.56]CARDINAL WOLSEY	So much fairer
[16:18.94]	And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
[16:21.96]	When the king knows my truth.
[16:24.26]SURREY	This cannot save you:
[16:26.03]	I thank my memory, I yet remember
[16:28.59]	Some of these articles; and out they shall.
[16:31.74]	Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,
[16:35.09]	You'll show a little honesty.
[16:37.38]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Speak on, sir;
[16:38.63]	I dare your worst objections: if I blush,
[16:41.65]	It is to see a nobleman want manners.
[16:44.47]SURREY	I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
[16:48.08]	First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,
[16:51.75]	You wrought to be a legate; by which power
[16:54.90]	You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.
[16:58.12]NORFOLK	Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
[17:01.27]	To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'
[17:03.96]	Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king
[17:07.64]	To be your servant.
[17:09.28]SUFFOLK	Then that, without the knowledge
[17:11.77]	Either of king or council, when you went
[17:14.79]	Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold
[17:17.81]	To carry into Flanders the great seal.
[17:20.70]SURREY	Item, you sent a large commission
[17:23.26]	To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,
[17:25.88]	Without the king's will or the state's allowance,
[17:29.49]	A league between his highness and Ferrara.
[17:32.64]SUFFOLK	That, out of mere ambition, you have caused
[17:35.79]	Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.
[17:39.27]SURREY	Then that you have sent innumerable substance--
[17:42.68]	By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--
[17:46.29]	To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways
[17:49.31]	You have for dignities; to the mere undoing
[17:52.52]	Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;
[17:55.48]	Which, since they are of you, and odious,
[17:58.43]	I will not taint my mouth with.
[18:00.86]Chamberlain	O my lord,
[18:01.91]	Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:
[18:05.12]	His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
[18:08.21]	Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
[18:11.62]	So little of his great self.
[18:13.85]SURREY	I forgive him.
[18:15.17]SUFFOLK	Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,
[18:18.51]	Because all those things you have done of late,
[18:21.99]	By your power legatine, within this kingdom,
[18:25.21]	Fall into the compass of a praemunire,
[18:28.09]	That therefore such a writ be sued against you;
[18:31.57]	To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
[18:34.72]	Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
[18:37.35]	Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.
[18:40.83]NORFOLK	And so we'll leave you to your meditations
[18:44.04]	How to live better. For your stubborn answer
[18:47.32]	About the giving back the great seal to us,
[18:50.54]	The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
[18:54.34]	So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.
[18:57.76]	[Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY]
[18:58.54]CARDINAL WOLSEY	So farewell to the little good you bear me.
[19:01.76]	Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
[19:05.11]	This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
[19:08.52]	The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
[19:11.93]	And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
[19:15.34]	The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
[19:18.63]	And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
[19:21.97]	His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
[19:25.12]	And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
[19:28.27]	Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
[19:31.69]	This many summers in a sea of glory,
[19:34.44]	But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
[19:37.72]	At length broke under me and now has left me,
[19:41.07]	Weary and old with service, to the mercy
[19:44.09]	Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
[19:47.37]	Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
[19:50.65]	I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
[19:53.80]	Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
[19:57.28]	There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
[20:00.76]	That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
[20:04.04]	More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
[20:07.39]	And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
[20:10.41]	Never to hope again.
[20:12.11]	[Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed]
[20:12.90]	Why, how now, Cromwell!
[20:14.67]CROMWELL	I have no power to speak, sir.
[20:16.97]CARDINAL WOLSEY	What, amazed
[20:18.15]	At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder
[20:21.17]	A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
[20:24.38]	I am fall'n indeed.
[20:26.02]CROMWELL	How does your grace?
[20:27.73]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Why, well;
[20:28.71]	Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
[20:31.60]	I know myself now; and I feel within me
[20:34.56]	A peace above all earthly dignities,
[20:37.31]	A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,
[20:41.05]	I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,
[20:44.73]	These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken
[20:47.68]	A load would sink a navy, too much honour:
[20:50.77]	O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen
[20:53.72]	Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!
[20:56.87]CROMWELL	I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.
[21:00.61]CARDINAL WOLSEY	I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,
[21:03.43]	Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
[21:06.06]	To endure more miseries and greater far
[21:09.08]	Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
[21:12.09]	What news abroad?
[21:13.60]CROMWELL	The heaviest and the worst
[21:15.77]	Is your displeasure with the king.
[21:18.39]CARDINAL WOLSEY	God bless him!
[21:19.71]CROMWELL	The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen
[21:22.92]	Lord chancellor in your place.
[21:25.28]CARDINAL WOLSEY	That's somewhat sudden:
[21:27.19]	But he's a learned man. May he continue
[21:30.14]	Long in his highness' favour, and do justice
[21:33.36]	For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
[21:37.10]	When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,
[21:40.84]	May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?
[21:44.78]CROMWELL	That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
[21:47.66]	Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.
[21:50.68]CARDINAL WOLSEY	That's news indeed.
[21:52.32]CROMWELL	Last, that the Lady Anne,
[21:54.29]	Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
[21:57.51]	This day was view'd in open as his queen,
[22:00.59]	Going to chapel; and the voice is now
[22:03.41]	Only about her coronation.
[22:05.51]CARDINAL WOLSEY	There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,
[22:09.32]	The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
[22:12.54]	In that one woman I have lost for ever:
[22:15.49]	No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,
[22:18.70]	Or gild again the noble troops that waited
[22:21.92]	Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;
[22:25.20]	I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now
[22:27.96]	To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
[22:30.98]	That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
[22:34.39]	What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
[22:37.93]	Some little memory of me will stir him--
[22:40.89]	I know his noble nature--not to let
[22:43.58]	Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,
[22:46.92]	Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
[22:50.01]	For thine own future safety.
[22:52.24]CROMWELL	O my lord,
[22:53.29]	Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego
[22:56.44]	So good, so noble and so true a master?
[22:59.33]	Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
[23:02.74]	With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
[23:06.02]	The king shall have my service: but my prayers
[23:09.43]	For ever and for ever shall be yours.
[23:12.26]CARDINAL WOLSEY	Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
[23:15.27]	In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
[23:18.49]	Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
[23:21.64]	Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
[23:25.25]	And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
[23:28.14]	And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
[23:31.62]	Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
[23:35.03]	Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
[23:38.31]	And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
[23:41.85]	Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
[23:45.20]	A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
[23:48.74]	Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.
[23:51.83]	Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
[23:55.04]	By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
[23:58.39]	The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?
[24:01.48]	Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
[24:05.41]	Corruption wins not more than honesty.
[24:08.30]	Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
[24:11.52]	To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
[24:15.06]	Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
[24:18.67]	Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,
[24:21.88]	O Cromwell,
[24:23.00]	Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;
[24:26.35]	And,--prithee, lead me in:
[24:28.25]	There take an inventory of all I have,
[24:31.14]	To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,
[24:34.22]	And my integrity to heaven, is all
[24:36.85]	I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!
[24:40.19]	Had I but served my God with half the zeal
[24:43.41]	I served my king, he would not in mine age
[24:46.56]	Have left me naked to mine enemies.
[24:49.25]CROMWELL	Good sir, have patience.
[24:51.15]CARDINAL WOLSEY	So I have. Farewell
[24:52.79]	The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.
[24:56.27]	[Exeunt]
