[00:00.43]	[London. A street.,]
[00:01.29]	[Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH]
[00:02.16]BARDOLPH	Well met, Corporal Nym.
[00:04.18]NYM	Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
[00:06.92]BARDOLPH	What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
[00:10.52]NYM	For my part, I care not: I say little; but when
[00:14.20]	time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that
[00:18.09]	shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will
[00:21.91]	wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but
[00:26.02]	what though? it will toast cheese, and it will
[00:29.70]	endure cold as another man's sword will: and
[00:33.30]	there's an end.
[00:34.82]BARDOLPH	I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and
[00:38.86]	we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
[00:42.97]	be so, good Corporal Nym.
[00:45.13]NYM	Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the
[00:48.88]	certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I
[00:52.92]	will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the
[00:56.59]	rendezvous of it.
[00:58.25]BARDOLPH	It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell
[01:02.29]	Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you
[01:06.18]	were troth-plight to her.
[01:08.42]NYM	I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may
[01:12.38]	sleep, and they may have their throats about them at
[01:16.56]	that time; and some say knives have edges. It must
[01:20.53]	be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet
[01:24.50]	she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I
[01:28.32]	cannot tell.
[01:29.61]	[Enter PISTOL and Hostess]
[01:30.48]BARDOLPH	Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
[01:34.08]	corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!
[01:38.12]PISTOL	Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,
[01:42.02]	I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
[01:46.49]Hostess	No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and
[01:50.38]	board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live
[01:54.27]	honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will
[01:58.38]	be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
[02:01.84]	[NYM and PISTOL draw]
[02:02.71]	O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we
[02:06.31]	shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.
[02:10.13]BARDOLPH	Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.
[02:14.10]NYM	Pish!
[02:14.89]PISTOL	Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!
[02:19.51]Hostess	Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.
[02:23.98]NYM	Will you shog off? I would have you solus.
[02:27.37]PISTOL	'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!
[02:30.18]	The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;
[02:33.35]	The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
[02:36.74]	And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,
[02:40.49]	And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
[02:43.95]	I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;
[02:46.98]	For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
[02:50.22]	And flashing fire will follow.
[02:52.82]NYM	I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an
[02:56.85]	humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow
[03:00.96]	foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my
[03:04.64]	rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk
[03:08.53]	off, I would prick your guts a little, in good
[03:12.21]	terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.
[03:15.74]PISTOL	O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
[03:19.13]	The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;
[03:22.81]	Therefore exhale.
[03:24.47]BARDOLPH	Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the
[03:28.29]	first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.
[03:33.05]	[Draws]
[03:33.91]PISTOL	An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.
[03:37.59]	Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
[03:41.05]	Thy spirits are most tall.
[03:43.36]NYM	I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair
[03:47.25]	terms: that is the humour of it.
[03:49.92]PISTOL	'Couple a gorge!'
[03:51.43]	That is the word. I thee defy again.
[03:54.39]	O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
[03:58.28]	No; to the spital go,
[04:00.16]	And from the powdering tub of infamy
[04:03.26]	Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
[04:06.93]	Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
[04:10.47]	I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly
[04:14.00]	For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.
[04:17.89]	[Enter the Boy]
[04:18.76]Boy	Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and
[04:22.65]	you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.
[04:26.33]	Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and
[04:30.37]	do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.
[04:34.48]BARDOLPH	Away, you rogue!
[04:35.99]Hostess	By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of
[04:40.03]	these days. The king has killed his heart. Good
[04:43.78]	husband, come home presently.
[04:46.23]	[Exeunt Hostess and Boy]
[04:47.09]BARDOLPH	Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to
[04:50.77]	France together: why the devil should we keep
[04:54.45]	knives to cut one another's throats?
[04:57.48]PISTOL	Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!
[05:01.44]NYM	You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
[05:06.06]PISTOL	Base is the slave that pays.
[05:08.51]NYM	That now I will have: that's the humour of it.
[05:12.18]PISTOL	As manhood shall compound: push home.
[05:15.21]	[They draw]
[05:16.08]BARDOLPH	By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll
[05:20.12]	kill him; by this sword, I will.
[05:22.71]PISTOL	Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
[05:26.75]BARDOLPH	Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:
[05:30.64]	an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.
[05:34.61]	Prithee, put up.
[05:36.12]NYM	I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?
[05:40.59]PISTOL	A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;
[05:43.91]	And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
[05:47.22]	And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:
[05:50.90]	I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;
[05:54.36]	Is not this just? for I shall sutler be
[05:57.61]	Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.
[06:00.78]	Give me thy hand.
[06:02.44]NYM	I shall have my noble?
[06:04.46]PISTOL	In cash most justly paid.
[06:06.69]NYM	Well, then, that's the humour of't.
[06:09.50]	[Re-enter Hostess]
[06:10.37]Hostess	As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir
[06:14.33]	John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning
[06:18.23]	quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to
[06:22.12]	behold. Sweet men, come to him.
[06:24.64]NYM	The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's
[06:28.75]	the even of it.
[06:30.27]PISTOL	Nym, thou hast spoke the right;
[06:32.86]	His heart is fracted and corroborate.
[06:35.96]NYM	The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;
[06:39.93]	he passes some humours and careers.
[06:42.89]PISTOL	Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will live.
