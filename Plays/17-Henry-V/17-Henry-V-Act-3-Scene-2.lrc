[00:00.37]	[The same.,]
[00:01.11]	[Enter NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, and Boy]
[00:01.85]BARDOLPH	On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!
[00:04.88]NYM	Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;
[00:08.15]	and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:
[00:11.55]	the humour of it is too hot, that is the very
[00:14.70]	plain-song of it.
[00:16.13]PISTOL	The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:
[00:19.59]	Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
[00:22.80]	And sword and shield,
[00:24.47]	In bloody field,
[00:25.83]	Doth win immortal fame.
[00:27.62]Boy	Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give
[00:31.14]	all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.
[00:33.99]PISTOL	And I:
[00:34.73]	If wishes would prevail with me,
[00:37.08]	My purpose should not fail with me,
[00:39.61]	But thither would I hie.
[00:41.46]	Boy As duly, but not as truly,
[00:43.63]	As bird doth sing on bough.
[00:45.67]	[Enter FLUELLEN]
[00:46.41]FLUELLEN	Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions!
[00:49.62]	[Driving them forward]
[00:50.36]PISTOL	Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.
[00:53.15]	Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,
[00:55.74]	Abate thy rage, great duke!
[00:57.72]	Good bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet chuck!
[01:01.18]NYM	These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.
[01:04.70]	[Exeunt all but Boy]
[01:05.44]Boy	As young as I am, I have observed these three
[01:08.60]	swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
[01:12.00]	three, though they would serve me, could not be man
[01:15.46]	to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
[01:19.04]	a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
[01:22.07]	red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but
[01:25.53]	fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
[01:28.81]	and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks
[01:32.14]	words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
[01:35.36]	heard that men of few words are the best men; and
[01:38.76]	therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'
[01:41.97]	should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
[01:45.37]	are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never
[01:48.64]	broke any man's head but his own, and that was
[01:51.86]	against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
[01:55.26]	any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
[01:58.59]	lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
[02:01.99]	three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
[02:05.08]	brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
[02:08.42]	fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
[02:11.76]	men would carry coals. They would have me as
[02:14.85]	familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
[02:18.49]	handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
[02:21.89]	if I should take from another's pocket to put into
[02:25.42]	mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
[02:28.63]	must leave them, and seek some better service:
[02:31.78]	their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
[02:35.06]	therefore I must cast it up.
[02:37.16]	[Exit]
[02:37.90]	[Re-enter FLUELLEN, GOWER following]
[02:38.64]GOWER	Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the
[02:41.98]	mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
[02:45.44]FLUELLEN	To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good
[02:48.84]	to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is
[02:52.12]	not according to the disciplines of the war: the
[02:55.45]	concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,
[02:58.85]	the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look
[03:02.31]	you, is digt himself four yard under the
[03:05.16]	countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough up
[03:08.49]	all, if there is not better directions.
[03:11.21]GOWER	The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the
[03:14.55]	siege is given, is altogether directed by an
[03:17.64]	Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.
[03:20.61]FLUELLEN	It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
[03:23.08]GOWER	I think it be.
[03:24.31]FLUELLEN	By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will
[03:27.53]	verify as much in his beard: be has no more
[03:30.56]	directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look
[03:34.14]	you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.
[03:37.54]	[Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY]
[03:38.28]GOWER	Here a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
[03:42.18]FLUELLEN	Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,
[03:45.57]	that is certain; and of great expedition and
[03:48.66]	knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular
[03:52.13]	knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he will
[03:55.34]	maintain his argument as well as any military man in
[03:58.99]	the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars
[04:02.45]	of the Romans.
[04:03.68]JAMY	I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.
[04:05.97]FLUELLEN	God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
[04:09.00]GOWER	How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit the
[04:12.09]	mines? have the pioneers given o'er?
[04:14.62]MACMORRIS	By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish give
[04:17.77]	over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I
[04:21.11]	swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done;
[04:24.51]	it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town, so
[04:28.10]	Chrish save me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done,
[04:31.25]	tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!
[04:34.03]FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you
[04:37.18]	voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you,
[04:40.58]	as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
[04:44.16]	the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument,
[04:47.38]	look you, and friendly communication; partly to
[04:50.59]	satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction,
[04:54.11]	look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of
[04:57.51]	the military discipline; that is the point.
[05:00.48]JAMY	It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath:
[05:03.82]	and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick
[05:07.15]	occasion; that sall I, marry.
[05:09.19]MACMORRIS	It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the
[05:12.59]	day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the
[05:15.93]	king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The
[05:19.39]	town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the
[05:22.79]	breach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:
[05:25.88]	'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to
[05:29.16]	stand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is
[05:32.49]	throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there
[05:35.89]	ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!
[05:38.49]JAMY	By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves
[05:42.07]	to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'
[05:45.35]	the grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay
[05:48.75]	't as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,
[05:52.08]	that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad full
[05:55.42]	fain hear some question 'tween you tway.
[05:58.20]FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your
[06:01.42]	correction, there is not many of your nation--
[06:04.51]MACMORRIS	Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,
[06:07.72]	and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish
[06:11.06]	my nation? Who talks of my nation?
[06:13.47]FLUELLEN	Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is
[06:16.93]	meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think
[06:20.45]	you do not use me with that affability as in
[06:23.60]	discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as
[06:27.00]	good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
[06:30.46]	war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in
[06:33.62]	other particularities.
[06:35.35]MACMORRIS	I do not know you so good a man as myself: so
[06:38.50]	Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
[06:41.34]GOWER	Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
[06:44.37]JAMY	A! that's a foul fault.
[06:46.10]	[A parley sounded]
[06:46.84]GOWER	The town sounds a parley.
[06:48.76]FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, when there is more better
[06:51.85]	opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so
[06:55.25]	bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war;
[06:58.71]	and there is an end.
[07:00.32]	[Exeunt]
