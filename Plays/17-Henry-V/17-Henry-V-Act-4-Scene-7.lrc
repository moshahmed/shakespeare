[00:00.39]	[Another part of the field.,]
[00:01.18]	[Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER]
[00:01.98]FLUELLEN	Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly
[00:05.28]	against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of
[00:08.92]	knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in your
[00:12.42]	conscience, now, is it not?
[00:14.47]GOWER	'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the
[00:18.10]	cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done
[00:21.80]	this slaughter: besides, they have burned and
[00:25.11]	carried away all that was in the king's tent;
[00:28.48]	wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every
[00:32.25]	soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a
[00:35.62]	gallant king!
[00:36.87]FLUELLEN	Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What
[00:40.31]	call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!
[00:44.54]GOWER	Alexander the Great.
[00:46.26]FLUELLEN	Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the
[00:49.76]	great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the
[00:52.73]	magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase
[00:56.50]	is a little variations.
[00:58.42]GOWER	I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his
[01:02.25]	father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
[01:05.88]FLUELLEN	I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I
[01:09.65]	tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the
[01:13.22]	'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons
[01:16.79]	between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,
[01:20.42]	look you, is both alike. There is a river in
[01:23.66]	Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at
[01:27.10]	Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is
[01:30.67]	out of my prains what is the name of the other
[01:34.17]	river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is
[01:37.81]	to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you
[01:41.51]	mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life
[01:45.34]	is come after it indifferent well; for there is
[01:48.84]	figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and
[01:52.28]	you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his
[01:55.65]	wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his
[01:59.02]	displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a
[02:02.79]	little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and
[02:06.69]	his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.
[02:10.32]GOWER	Our king is not like him in that: he never killed
[02:13.96]	any of his friends.
[02:15.61]FLUELLEN	It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out
[02:19.44]	of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
[02:23.01]	but in the figures and comparisons of it: as
[02:26.31]	Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his
[02:29.95]	ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in
[02:33.65]	his right wits and his good judgments, turned away
[02:37.35]	the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he
[02:40.85]	was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and
[02:44.29]	mocks; I have forgot his name.
[02:46.60]GOWER	Sir John Falstaff.
[02:48.19]FLUELLEN	That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.
[02:52.55]GOWER	Here comes his majesty.
[02:54.47]	[Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, and forces; WARWICK,
[02:54.86]	+ GLOUCESTER, EXETER, and others]
[02:55.26]KING HENRY V	I was not angry since I came to France
[02:58.23]	Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;
[03:01.34]	Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
[03:04.38]	If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
[03:07.82]	Or void the field; they do offend our sight:
[03:11.06]	If they'll do neither, we will come to them,
[03:14.29]	And make them skirr away, as swift as stones
[03:17.60]	Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
[03:20.51]	Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,
[03:24.01]	And not a man of them that we shall take
[03:27.11]	Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
[03:30.29]	[Enter MONTJOY]
[03:31.08]EXETER	Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
[03:34.45]GLOUCESTER	His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
[03:37.62]KING HENRY V	How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not
[03:41.19]	That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
[03:44.83]	Comest thou again for ransom?
[03:47.14]MONTJOY	No, great king:
[03:48.46]	I come to thee for charitable licence,
[03:51.37]	That we may wander o'er this bloody field
[03:54.54]	To look our dead, and then to bury them;
[03:57.52]	To sort our nobles from our common men.
[04:00.49]	For many of our princes--woe the while!--
[04:03.40]	Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;
[04:06.57]	So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
[04:09.87]	In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds
[04:13.24]	Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
[04:16.61]	Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
[04:20.25]	Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
[04:23.69]	To view the field in safety and dispose
[04:26.73]	Of their dead bodies!
[04:28.51]KING HENRY V	I tell thee truly, herald,
[04:30.56]	I know not if the day be ours or no;
[04:33.33]	For yet a many of your horsemen peer
[04:36.18]	And gallop o'er the field.
[04:38.29]MONTJOY	The day is yours.
[04:39.81]KING HENRY V	Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
[04:43.05]	What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?
[04:46.55]MONTJOY	They call it Agincourt.
[04:48.47]KING HENRY V	Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
[04:51.58]	Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
[04:54.62]FLUELLEN	Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your
[04:58.38]	majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack
[05:01.82]	Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,
[05:05.45]	fought a most prave pattle here in France.
[05:08.63]KING HENRY V	They did, Fluellen.
[05:10.21]FLUELLEN	Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is
[05:13.85]	remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a
[05:17.68]	garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their
[05:21.45]	Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this
[05:24.88]	hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do
[05:28.72]	believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek
[05:32.62]	upon Saint Tavy's day.
[05:34.47]KING HENRY V	I wear it for a memorable honour;
[05:37.04]	For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.
[05:40.08]FLUELLEN	All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's
[05:43.65]	Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:
[05:47.29]	God pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases
[05:51.05]	his grace, and his majesty too!
[05:53.43]KING HENRY V	Thanks, good my countryman.
[05:55.55]FLUELLEN	By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I care not
[05:59.32]	who know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: I
[06:02.88]	need not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised be
[06:06.58]	God, so long as your majesty is an honest man.
[06:09.96]KING HENRY V	God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:
[06:12.93]	Bring me just notice of the numbers dead
[06:16.04]	On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.
[06:19.34]	[Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy]
[06:20.13]EXETER	Soldier, you must come to the king.
[06:22.78]KING HENRY V	Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?
[06:26.28]WILLIAMS	An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one that
[06:29.98]	I should fight withal, if he be alive.
[06:32.82]KING HENRY V	An Englishman?
[06:34.14]WILLIAMS	An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered
[06:37.78]	with me last night; who, if alive and ever dare to
[06:41.41]	challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box
[06:45.25]	o' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,
[06:48.62]	which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear
[06:52.25]	if alive, I will strike it out soundly.
[06:55.16]KING HENRY V	What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit this
[06:58.66]	soldier keep his oath?
[07:00.51]FLUELLEN	He is a craven and a villain else, an't please your
[07:04.28]	majesty, in my conscience.
[07:06.33]KING HENRY V	It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,
[07:09.96]	quite from the answer of his degree.
[07:12.74]FLUELLEN	Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as
[07:16.57]	Lucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, look
[07:20.27]	your grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: if
[07:23.84]	he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as
[07:27.41]	arrant a villain and a Jacksauce, as ever his black
[07:31.18]	shoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in my
[07:34.75]	conscience, la!
[07:36.07]KING HENRY V	Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.
[07:40.03]WILLIAMS	So I will, my liege, as I live.
[07:42.35]KING HENRY V	Who servest thou under?
[07:44.26]WILLIAMS	Under Captain Gower, my liege.
[07:46.58]FLUELLEN	Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and
[07:50.28]	literatured in the wars.
[07:52.26]KING HENRY V	Call him hither to me, soldier.
[07:54.64]WILLIAMS	I will, my liege.
[07:56.09]	[Exit]
[07:56.89]KING HENRY V	Here, Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me and
[08:00.39]	stick it in thy cap: when Alencon and myself were
[08:04.02]	down together, I plucked this glove from his helm:
[08:07.66]	if any man challenge this, he is a friend to
[08:10.96]	Alencon, and an enemy to our person; if thou
[08:14.20]	encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.
[08:18.17]FLUELLEN	Your grace doo's me as great honours as can be
[08:21.67]	desired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fain
[08:25.44]	see the man, that has but two legs, that shall find
[08:29.14]	himself aggrieved at this glove; that is all; but I
[08:32.84]	would fain see it once, an please God of his grace
[08:36.54]	that I might see.
[08:38.06]KING HENRY V	Knowest thou Gower?
[08:39.71]FLUELLEN	He is my dear friend, an please you.
[08:42.42]KING HENRY V	Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
[08:45.92]FLUELLEN	I will fetch him.
[08:47.44]	[Exit]
[08:48.24]KING HENRY V	My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,
[08:51.61]	Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:
[08:54.45]	The glove which I have given him for a favour
[08:57.88]	May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;
[09:00.79]	It is the soldier's; I by bargain should
[09:03.83]	Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:
[09:07.01]	If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
[09:10.18]	By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
[09:13.42]	Some sudden mischief may arise of it;
[09:16.26]	For I do know Fluellen valiant
[09:18.70]	And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,
[09:21.81]	And quickly will return an injury:
[09:24.45]	Follow and see there be no harm between them.
[09:27.82]	Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.
