[00:00.39]	[Another part of the field.,]
[00:01.18]	[Alarums. Enter KING HENRY and forces, EXETER, and others]
[00:01.98]KING HENRY V	Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:
[00:05.28]	But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.
[00:08.92]EXETER	The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.
[00:12.35]KING HENRY V	Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour
[00:15.66]	I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;
[00:18.96]	From helmet to the spur all blood he was.
[00:22.07]EXETER	In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
[00:25.17]	Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
[00:28.28]	Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
[00:31.26]	The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
[00:34.03]	Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
[00:37.40]	Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
[00:40.71]	And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes
[00:44.08]	That bloodily did spawn upon his face;
[00:46.98]	And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
[00:50.16]	My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
[00:53.39]	Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
[00:56.63]	As in this glorious and well-foughten field
[00:59.94]	We kept together in our chivalry!'
[01:02.52]	Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:
[01:05.75]	He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
[01:09.06]	And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,
[01:12.23]	Commend my service to me sovereign.'
[01:14.94]	So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
[01:17.91]	He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
[01:21.28]	And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd
[01:24.72]	A testament of noble-ending love.
[01:27.30]	The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
[01:30.40]	Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
[01:33.97]	But I had not so much of man in me,
[01:36.68]	And all my mother came into mine eyes
[01:39.59]	And gave me up to tears.
[01:41.57]KING HENRY V	I blame you not;
[01:43.03]	For, hearing this, I must perforce compound
[01:46.20]	With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.
[01:49.31]	[Alarum]
[01:50.10]	But, hark! what new alarum is this same?
[01:53.01]	The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:
[01:56.51]	Then every soldier kill his prisoners:
[01:59.42]	Give the word through.
[02:01.27]	[Exeunt]
