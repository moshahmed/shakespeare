[00:00.34]	[Hall in Capulet's house.,]
[00:01.04]	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two
[00:01.39]	+ Servingmen]
[00:01.73]CAPULET	So many guests invite as here are writ.
[00:04.34]	[Exit First Servant]
[00:05.03]	Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
[00:07.64]Second Servant	You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
[00:10.83]	can lick their fingers.
[00:12.51]CAPULET	How canst thou try them so?
[00:14.42]Second Servant	Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
[00:17.49]	own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
[00:20.50]	fingers goes not with me.
[00:22.29]CAPULET	Go, be gone.
[00:23.28]	[Exit Second Servant]
[00:23.97]	We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
[00:26.81]	What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
[00:29.65]Nurse	Ay, forsooth.
[00:30.69]CAPULET	Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
[00:33.47]	A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
[00:35.96]Nurse	See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
[00:39.09]	[Enter JULIET]
[00:39.79]CAPULET	How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
[00:43.03]JULIET	Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
[00:45.81]	Of disobedient opposition
[00:47.66]	To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
[00:50.33]	By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
[00:52.99]	And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
[00:55.71]	Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
[00:58.15]CAPULET	Send for the county; go tell him of this:
[01:00.81]	I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
[01:03.82]JULIET	I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
[01:06.54]	And gave him what becomed love I might,
[01:09.15]	Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
[01:11.58]CAPULET	Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
[01:14.30]	This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
[01:17.26]	Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
[01:19.86]	Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
[01:22.47]	Our whole city is much bound to him.
[01:24.90]JULIET	Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
[01:27.63]	To help me sort such needful ornaments
[01:30.23]	As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
[01:32.95]LADY CAPULET	No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
[01:35.73]CAPULET	Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
[01:38.80]	[Exeunt JULIET and Nurse]
[01:39.50]LADY CAPULET	We shall be short in our provision:
[01:41.87]	'Tis now near night.
[01:43.32]CAPULET	Tush, I will stir about,
[01:45.00]	And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
[01:48.19]	Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
[01:50.74]	I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
[01:53.28]	I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
[01:56.30]	They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
[01:59.13]	To County Paris, to prepare him up
[02:01.45]	Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
[02:04.40]	Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
[02:07.36]	[Exeunt]
