[00:00.40]	[A room in Capulet's house.,]
[00:01.21]	[Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse]
[00:02.02]LADY CAPULET	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
[00:05.59]Nurse	Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
[00:08.69]	I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
[00:11.79]	God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
[00:14.96]	[Enter JULIET]
[00:15.77]JULIET	How now! who calls?
[00:17.39]Nurse	Your mother.
[00:18.60]JULIET	Madam, I am here.
[00:20.09]	What is your will?
[00:21.70]LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
[00:25.01]	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
[00:28.45]	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
[00:31.88]	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
[00:35.19]Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
[00:38.15]LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.
[00:39.84]Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
[00:42.27]	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
[00:45.97]	She is not fourteen. How long is it now
[00:49.01]	To Lammas-tide?
[00:50.42]LADY CAPULET	A fortnight and odd days.
[00:52.51]Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
[00:55.35]	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
[00:58.92]	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
[01:02.22]	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
[01:05.19]	She was too good for me: but, as I said,
[01:08.15]	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
[01:11.59]	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
[01:14.69]	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
[01:17.93]	And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
[01:21.23]	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
[01:24.47]	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
[01:27.50]	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
[01:30.94]	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
[01:33.77]	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
[01:36.60]	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
[01:40.04]	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
[01:43.21]	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
[01:46.52]	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
[01:50.09]	To bid me trudge:
[01:51.64]	And since that time it is eleven years;
[01:54.67]	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
[01:58.25]	She could have run and waddled all about;
[02:01.41]	For even the day before, she broke her brow:
[02:04.72]	And then my husband--God be with his soul!
[02:07.89]	A' was a merry man--took up the child:
[02:10.72]	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
[02:13.95]	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
[02:17.60]	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
[02:20.56]	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
[02:23.80]	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
[02:26.83]	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
[02:30.20]	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
[02:34.18]	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
[02:37.21]LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
[02:40.45]Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
[02:43.55]	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
[02:46.85]	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
[02:49.89]	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
[02:53.12]	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
[02:56.09]	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
[02:59.39]	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
[03:03.03]	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
[03:06.27]JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
[03:09.57]Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
[03:13.01]	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
[03:16.65]	An I might live to see thee married once,
[03:19.82]	I have my wish.
[03:21.24]LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
[03:24.00]	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
[03:27.24]	How stands your disposition to be married?
[03:30.47]JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.
[03:33.31]Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
[03:36.27]	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
[03:40.11]LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
[03:43.49]	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
[03:46.05]	Are made already mothers: by my count,
[03:48.95]	I was your mother much upon these years
[03:52.05]	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
[03:55.35]	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
[03:58.52]Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man
[04:01.15]	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
[04:04.18]LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
[04:07.22]Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
[04:10.39]LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
[04:13.49]	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
[04:16.92]	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
[04:20.09]	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
[04:23.60]	Examine every married lineament,
[04:26.16]	And see how one another lends content
[04:29.13]	And what obscured in this fair volume lies
[04:32.43]	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
[04:35.53]	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
[04:39.04]	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
[04:41.80]	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
[04:45.24]	For fair without the fair within to hide:
[04:48.41]	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
[04:51.91]	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
[04:55.42]	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
[04:58.79]	By having him, making yourself no less.
[05:01.76]Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
[05:04.66]LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
[05:07.83]JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
[05:10.99]	But no more deep will I endart mine eye
[05:14.10]	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
[05:17.74]	[Enter a Servant]
[05:18.54]Servant	Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
[05:22.12]	called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
[05:25.96]	the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
[05:29.53]	hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
[05:32.90]LADY CAPULET	We follow thee.
[05:34.32]	[Exit Servant]
[05:35.13]	Juliet, the county stays.
[05:37.15]Nurse	Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
[05:40.25]	[Exeunt]
