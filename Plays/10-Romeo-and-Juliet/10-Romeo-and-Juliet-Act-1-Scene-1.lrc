[00:00.40]	[Verona. A public place.,]
[00:01.21]	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
[00:01.62]	+ armed with swords and bucklers]
[00:02.43]SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
[00:05.54]GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.
[00:08.25]SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
[00:11.16]GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
[00:14.94]SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.
[00:17.31]GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
[00:20.49]SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
[00:23.60]GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
[00:27.32]	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
[00:30.84]SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
[00:34.63]	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
[00:38.22]GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
[00:42.00]	to the wall.
[00:43.22]SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
[00:47.01]	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
[00:50.80]	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
[00:54.59]	to the wall.
[00:55.80]GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
[00:59.73]SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
[01:03.31]	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
[01:07.10]	maids, and cut off their heads.
[01:09.54]GREGORY	The heads of the maids?
[01:11.50]SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
[01:15.08]	take it in what sense thou wilt.
[01:17.65]GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.
[01:20.76]SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
[01:24.42]	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
[01:27.46]GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
[01:30.98]	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
[01:34.50]	two of the house of the Montagues.
[01:37.20]SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
[01:40.86]GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?
[01:43.02]SAMPSON	Fear me not.
[01:44.24]GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!
[01:46.06]SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
[01:49.72]GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
[01:53.51]	they list.
[01:54.59]SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
[01:58.11]	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
[02:01.49]	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]
[02:02.30]ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
[02:04.94]SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.
[02:06.90]ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
[02:09.54]SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
[02:12.51]	ay?
[02:13.12]GREGORY	No.
[02:13.73]SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
[02:17.32]	bite my thumb, sir.
[02:18.94]GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?
[02:20.63]ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.
[02:22.32]SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
[02:26.52]ABRAHAM	No better.
[02:27.60]SAMPSON	Well, sir.
[02:28.61]GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
[02:32.33]SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.
[02:33.76]ABRAHAM	You lie.
[02:34.70]SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
[02:38.76]	[They fight]
[02:39.57]	[Enter BENVOLIO]
[02:40.38]BENVOLIO	Part, fools!
[02:41.53]	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
[02:44.92]	[Beats down their swords]
[02:45.73]	[Enter TYBALT]
[02:46.54]TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
[02:50.19]	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
[02:53.24]BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
[02:56.42]	Or manage it to part these men with me.
[02:59.46]TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
[03:02.91]	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
[03:05.89]	Have at thee, coward!
[03:07.65]	[They fight]
[03:08.46]	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
[03:08.86]	+ then enter Citizens, with clubs]
[03:09.27]First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
[03:12.92]	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
[03:16.51]	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]
[03:17.32]CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
[03:20.70]LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
[03:24.02]CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
[03:26.86]	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
[03:29.97]	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
[03:30.78]MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
[03:34.10]LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
[03:37.28]	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]
[03:38.09]PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
[03:41.00]	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
[03:44.24]	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
[03:47.76]	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
[03:51.21]	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
[03:54.73]	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
[03:58.04]	Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
[04:01.49]	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
[04:04.81]	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
[04:07.92]	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
[04:10.56]	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
[04:14.14]	And made Verona's ancient citizens
[04:16.92]	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
[04:20.03]	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
[04:23.07]	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
[04:26.66]	If ever you disturb our streets again,
[04:29.63]	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
[04:33.15]	For this time, all the rest depart away:
[04:36.20]	You Capulet; shall go along with me:
[04:38.97]	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
[04:41.88]	To know our further pleasure in this case,
[04:45.13]	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
[04:48.44]	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
[04:51.69]	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]
[04:52.50]MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
[04:55.68]	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
[04:58.72]BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,
[05:01.90]	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
[05:05.28]	I drew to part them: in the instant came
[05:08.40]	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
[05:11.57]	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
[05:14.75]	He swung about his head and cut the winds,
[05:18.00]	Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
[05:21.38]	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
[05:24.90]	Came more and more and fought on part and part,
[05:28.49]	Till the prince came, who parted either part.
[05:31.87]LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
[05:34.71]	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
[05:37.82]BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
[05:40.93]	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
[05:44.25]	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
[05:47.36]	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
[05:50.40]	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
[05:53.72]	So early walking did I see your son:
[05:56.56]	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
[05:59.74]	And stole into the covert of the wood:
[06:02.72]	I, measuring his affections by my own,
[06:05.62]	That most are busied when they're most alone,
[06:09.07]	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
[06:11.85]	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
[06:15.16]MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
[06:18.21]	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
[06:21.59]	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
[06:25.31]	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
[06:28.42]	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
[06:31.67]	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
[06:34.58]	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
[06:38.03]	And private in his chamber pens himself,
[06:41.14]	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
[06:44.52]	And makes himself an artificial night:
[06:47.50]	Black and portentous must this humour prove,
[06:50.88]	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
[06:54.06]BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
[06:56.97]MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.
[07:00.01]BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?
[07:02.92]MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:
[07:05.90]	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
[07:08.81]	Is to himself--I will not say how true--
[07:11.78]	But to himself so secret and so close,
[07:14.76]	So far from sounding and discovery,
[07:17.53]	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
[07:20.58]	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
[07:24.09]	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
[07:26.80]	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
[07:30.45]	We would as willingly give cure as know.
[07:33.56]	[Enter ROMEO]
[07:34.38]BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
[07:37.76]	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
[07:41.01]MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
[07:44.05]	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
[07:47.30]	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
[07:48.11]BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.
[07:49.80]ROMEO	Is the day so young?
[07:51.56]BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.
[07:53.32]ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
[07:55.48]	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
[07:58.80]BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
[08:02.18]ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
[08:05.70]BENVOLIO	In love?
[08:06.64]ROMEO	Out--
[08:07.32]BENVOLIO	Of love?
[08:08.27]ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.
[08:11.18]BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
[08:14.09]	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
[08:17.33]ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
[08:20.65]	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
[08:24.10]	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
[08:27.48]	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
[08:30.59]	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
[08:34.18]	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
[08:37.22]	O any thing, of nothing first create!
[08:40.06]	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
[08:42.70]	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
[08:45.74]	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
[08:48.79]	sick health!
[08:50.01]	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
[08:53.25]	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
[08:56.57]	Dost thou not laugh?
[08:58.33]BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.
[09:00.15]ROMEO	Good heart, at what?
[09:01.84]BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.
[09:04.35]ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.
[09:06.98]	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
[09:10.23]	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
[09:13.55]	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
[09:17.33]	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
[09:20.72]	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
[09:24.23]	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
[09:27.68]	Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
[09:31.20]	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
[09:34.31]	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
[09:37.29]	Farewell, my coz.
[09:38.78]BENVOLIO	Soft! I will go along;
[09:40.60]	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
[09:43.58]ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
[09:46.49]	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
[09:49.60]BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
[09:52.71]ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?
[09:55.35]BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.
[09:56.64]	But sadly tell me who.
[09:58.53]ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
[10:01.64]	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
[10:04.75]	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
[10:07.60]BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
[10:10.84]ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
[10:14.23]BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
[10:17.47]ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
[10:20.85]	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
[10:23.90]	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
[10:27.21]	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
[10:30.93]	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
[10:34.32]	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
[10:37.50]	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
[10:40.54]	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
[10:43.25]	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
[10:46.76]BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
[10:50.69]ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
[10:54.20]	For beauty starved with her severity
[10:57.11]	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
[10:59.89]	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
[11:03.07]	To merit bliss by making me despair:
[11:05.91]	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
[11:09.15]	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
[11:12.27]BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
[11:15.24]ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.
[11:18.35]BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
[11:21.06]	Examine other beauties.
[11:23.02]ROMEO	'Tis the way
[11:24.24]	To call hers exquisite, in question more:
[11:27.35]	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
[11:30.87]	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
[11:34.39]	He that is strucken blind cannot forget
[11:37.50]	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
[11:40.81]	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
[11:43.92]	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
[11:47.10]	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
[11:50.62]	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
[11:53.94]BENVOLIO	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
[11:57.25]	[Exeunt]
