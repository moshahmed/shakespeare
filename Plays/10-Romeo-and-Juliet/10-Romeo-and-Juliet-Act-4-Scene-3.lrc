[00:00.48]	[Juliet's chamber.,]
[00:01.44]	[Enter JULIET and Nurse]
[00:02.40]JULIET	Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
[00:06.33]	I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
[00:10.02]	For I have need of many orisons
[00:13.07]	To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
[00:17.00]	Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
[00:21.41]	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
[00:22.38]LADY CAPULET	What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
[00:25.90]JULIET	No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
[00:29.67]	As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
[00:33.45]	So please you, let me now be left alone,
[00:37.05]	And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
[00:41.15]	For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
[00:45.08]	In this so sudden business.
[00:47.72]LADY CAPULET	Good night:
[00:49.09]	Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
[00:53.10]	[Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse]
[00:54.06]JULIET	Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
[00:58.07]	I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
[01:02.56]	That almost freezes up the heat of life:
[01:06.25]	I'll call them back again to comfort me:
[01:09.94]	Nurse! What should she do here?
[01:12.83]	My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
[01:16.44]	Come, vial.
[01:17.72]	What if this mixture do not work at all?
[01:21.41]	Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
[01:25.26]	No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
[01:29.11]	[Laying down her dagger]
[01:30.08]	What if it be a poison, which the friar
[01:33.69]	Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
[01:37.30]	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
[01:41.55]	Because he married me before to Romeo?
[01:45.08]	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
[01:49.09]	For he hath still been tried a holy man.
[01:52.78]	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
[01:56.15]	I wake before the time that Romeo
[01:59.36]	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
[02:03.21]	Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
[02:06.98]	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
[02:11.47]	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
[02:15.40]	Or, if I live, is it not very like,
[02:18.53]	The horrible conceit of death and night,
[02:22.22]	Together with the terror of the place,--
[02:25.75]	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
[02:29.12]	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
[02:33.21]	Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
[02:36.74]	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
[02:40.67]	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
[02:44.92]	At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
[02:48.77]	Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
[02:51.98]	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
[02:55.91]	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
[03:00.32]	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
[03:04.09]	O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
[03:07.62]	Environed with all these hideous fears?
[03:11.23]	And madly play with my forefather's joints?
[03:15.16]	And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
[03:19.25]	And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
[03:23.58]	As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
[03:27.59]	O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
[03:31.28]	Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
[03:35.05]	Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
[03:38.66]	Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
[03:42.11]	[She falls upon her bed, within the curtains]
