[00:00.41]	[A street.,]
[00:01.23]	[Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six
[00:01.64]	+ Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others]
[00:02.05]ROMEO	What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
[00:05.67]	Or shall we on without a apology?
[00:08.34]BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:
[00:11.08]	We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
[00:14.50]	Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
[00:17.58]	Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
[00:20.59]	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
[00:23.94]	After the prompter, for our entrance:
[00:26.81]	But let them measure us by what they will;
[00:30.10]	We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
[00:33.31]ROMEO	Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
[00:36.60]	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
[00:39.61]MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
[00:42.75]ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
[00:45.90]	With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
[00:49.05]	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
[00:52.26]MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
[00:55.21]	And soar with them above a common bound.
[00:58.35]ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
[01:01.43]	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
[01:04.92]	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
[01:07.93]	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
[01:10.80]MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
[01:14.02]	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
[01:17.17]ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
[01:20.25]	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
[01:24.01]MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
[01:27.50]	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
[01:31.12]	Give me a case to put my visage in:
[01:33.93]	A visor for a visor! what care I
[01:36.53]	What curious eye doth quote deformities?
[01:39.68]	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
[01:43.17]BENVOLIO	Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
[01:46.18]	But every man betake him to his legs.
[01:49.12]ROMEO	A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
[01:52.40]	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
[01:55.89]	For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
[01:59.24]	I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
[02:02.12]	The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
[02:05.33]MERCUTIO	Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
[02:08.82]	If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
[02:12.38]	Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
[02:16.14]	Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
[02:19.29]ROMEO	Nay, that's not so.
[02:20.93]MERCUTIO	I mean, sir, in delay
[02:22.71]	We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
[02:26.27]	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
[02:29.69]	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
[02:33.18]ROMEO	And we mean well in going to this mask;
[02:36.26]	But 'tis no wit to go.
[02:38.10]MERCUTIO	Why, may one ask?
[02:39.61]ROMEO	I dream'd a dream to-night.
[02:41.87]MERCUTIO	And so did I.
[02:43.17]ROMEO	Well, what was yours?
[02:44.94]MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.
[02:47.00]ROMEO	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
[02:50.55]MERCUTIO	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
[02:53.84]	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
[02:57.05]	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
[03:00.13]	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
[03:02.87]	Drawn with a team of little atomies
[03:05.74]	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
[03:08.82]	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
[03:12.17]	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
[03:15.25]	The traces of the smallest spider's web,
[03:18.40]	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
[03:21.82]	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
[03:25.24]	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
[03:28.18]	Not so big as a round little worm
[03:30.92]	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
[03:34.00]	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
[03:36.73]	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
[03:39.88]	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
[03:43.03]	And in this state she gallops night by night
[03:46.52]	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
[03:50.35]	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
[03:54.52]	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
[03:58.22]	O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
[04:01.77]	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
[04:05.33]	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
[04:09.16]	Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
[04:12.58]	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
[04:15.87]	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
[04:19.49]	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
[04:22.78]	Then dreams, he of another benefice:
[04:25.58]	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
[04:28.94]	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
[04:32.49]	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
[04:35.57]	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
[04:38.86]	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
[04:42.41]	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
[04:46.04]	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
[04:49.12]	That plats the manes of horses in the night,
[04:52.54]	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
[04:56.10]	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
[04:59.45]	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
[05:03.01]	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
[05:06.70]	Making them women of good carriage:
[05:09.51]	This is she--
[05:10.74]ROMEO	Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
[05:12.99]	Thou talk'st of nothing.
[05:15.05]MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,
[05:16.96]	Which are the children of an idle brain,
[05:20.11]	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
[05:22.85]	Which is as thin of substance as the air
[05:26.06]	And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
[05:29.48]	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
[05:32.56]	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
[05:35.78]	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
[05:39.13]BENVOLIO	This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
[05:42.69]	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
[05:45.97]ROMEO	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
[05:48.98]	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
[05:52.27]	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
[05:55.28]	With this night's revels and expire the term
[05:58.76]	Of a despised life closed in my breast
[06:01.84]	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
[06:04.92]	But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
[06:08.27]	Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
[06:11.01]BENVOLIO	Strike, drum.
[06:12.24]	[Exeunt]
