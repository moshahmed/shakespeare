[00:00.40]	[Friar Laurence's cell.,]
[00:01.22]	[Enter FRIAR JOHN]
[00:02.03]FRIAR JOHN	Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
[00:04.67]	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]
[00:05.49]FRIAR LAURENCE	This same should be the voice of Friar John.
[00:08.87]	Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
[00:11.72]	Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
[00:14.98]FRIAR JOHN	Going to find a bare-foot brother out
[00:17.96]	One of our order, to associate me,
[00:20.60]	Here in this city visiting the sick,
[00:23.45]	And finding him, the searchers of the town,
[00:26.70]	Suspecting that we both were in a house
[00:29.82]	Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
[00:33.07]	Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
[00:36.67]	So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
[00:40.06]FRIAR LAURENCE	Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
[00:42.70]FRIAR JOHN	I could not send it,--here it is again,--
[00:45.61]	Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
[00:48.53]	So fearful were they of infection.
[00:51.24]FRIAR LAURENCE	Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
[00:53.95]	The letter was not nice but full of charge
[00:57.27]	Of dear import, and the neglecting it
[01:00.19]	May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
[01:03.24]	Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
[01:06.49]	Unto my cell.
[01:07.78]FRIAR JOHN	Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
[01:10.49]	[Exit]
[01:11.30]FRIAR LAURENCE	Now must I to the monument alone;
[01:13.95]	Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
[01:17.13]	She will beshrew me much that Romeo
[01:19.98]	Hath had no notice of these accidents;
[01:22.96]	But I will write again to Mantua,
[01:25.61]	And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
[01:28.72]	Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
[01:32.25]	[Exit]
