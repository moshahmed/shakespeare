[00:00.45]	[Friar Laurence's cell.,]
[00:01.37]	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO]
[00:02.29]FRIAR LAURENCE	So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
[00:05.80]	That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
[00:09.47]ROMEO	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
[00:12.60]	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
[00:16.27]	That one short minute gives me in her sight:
[00:20.09]	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
[00:23.91]	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
[00:27.58]	It is enough I may but call her mine.
[00:30.86]FRIAR LAURENCE	These violent delights have violent ends
[00:34.46]	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
[00:38.43]	Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
[00:42.40]	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
[00:45.76]	And in the taste confounds the appetite:
[00:49.28]	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
[00:53.10]	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
[00:56.54]	[Enter JULIET]
[00:57.45]	Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
[01:00.82]	Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
[01:04.48]	A lover may bestride the gossamer
[01:07.54]	That idles in the wanton summer air,
[01:10.75]	And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
[01:13.96]JULIET	Good even to my ghostly confessor.
[01:17.01]FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
[01:20.83]JULIET	As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
[01:24.58]ROMEO	Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
[01:27.79]	Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
[01:31.84]	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
[01:35.51]	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
[01:39.55]	Unfold the imagined happiness that both
[01:43.07]	Receive in either by this dear encounter.
[01:46.66]JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
[01:50.33]	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
[01:53.77]	They are but beggars that can count their worth;
[01:57.89]	But my true love is grown to such excess
[02:01.48]	I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
[02:04.85]FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
[02:08.82]	For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
[02:12.64]	Till holy church incorporate two in one.
[02:16.15]	[Exeunt]
