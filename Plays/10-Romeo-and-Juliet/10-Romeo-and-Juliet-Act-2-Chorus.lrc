[00:00.52]	[ACT II PROLOGUE]
[00:01.57]	[Enter Chorus]
[00:02.62]Chorus	Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
[00:06.73]	And young affection gapes to be his heir;
[00:10.85]	That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
[00:15.83]	With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
[00:20.12]	Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
[00:23.88]	Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
[00:27.82]	But to his foe supposed he must complain,
[00:31.93]	And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
[00:36.92]	Being held a foe, he may not have access
[00:40.95]	To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
[00:45.32]	And she as much in love, her means much less
[00:49.70]	To meet her new-beloved any where:
[00:53.20]	But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
[00:57.92]	Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
[01:02.03]	[Exit]
