[00:00.63]	[A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.,]
[00:01.89]	[Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch]
[00:03.15]PARIS	Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
[00:08.40]	Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
[00:13.13]	Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
[00:17.96]	Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
[00:23.32]	So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
[00:28.46]	Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
[00:33.82]	But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
[00:38.86]	As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
[00:44.43]	Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
[00:49.47]PAGE	[Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
[00:54.31]	Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
[00:59.56]	[Retires]
[01:00.82]PARIS	Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
[01:06.60]	O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
[01:11.01]	Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
[01:16.05]	Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
[01:21.52]	The obsequies that I for thee will keep
[01:26.35]	Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
[01:31.71]	[The Page whistles]
[01:32.97]	The boy gives warning something doth approach.
[01:38.43]	What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
[01:43.58]	To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
[01:48.72]	What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
[01:53.66]	[Retires]
[01:54.92]	[Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch,
[01:55.55]	+ mattock, &c]
[01:56.18]ROMEO	Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
[02:01.43]	Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
[02:06.58]	See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
[02:11.62]	Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
[02:17.09]	Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
[02:22.66]	And do not interrupt me in my course.
[02:27.17]	Why I descend into this bed of death,
[02:31.69]	Is partly to behold my lady's face;
[02:36.00]	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
[02:41.67]	A precious ring, a ring that I must use
[02:46.40]	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
[02:51.54]	But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
[02:56.27]	In what I further shall intend to do,
[03:00.79]	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
[03:05.83]	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
[03:11.50]	The time and my intents are savage-wild,
[03:16.34]	More fierce and more inexorable far
[03:20.75]	Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
[03:25.27]BALTHASAR	I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
[03:29.99]ROMEO	So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
[03:35.67]	Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
[03:41.34]BALTHASAR	[Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
[03:46.91]	His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
[03:51.84]	[Retires]
[03:53.10]ROMEO	Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
[03:57.83]	Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
[04:03.08]	Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
[04:07.81]	And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
[04:13.17]	[Opens the tomb]
[04:14.43]PARIS	This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
[04:19.16]	That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
[04:24.83]	It is supposed, the fair creature died;
[04:29.45]	And here is come to do some villanous shame
[04:34.70]	To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
[04:39.54]	[Comes forward]
[04:40.80]	Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
[04:45.53]	Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
[04:50.78]	Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
[04:55.40]	Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
[05:00.02]ROMEO	I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
[05:05.06]	Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
[05:10.32]	Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
[05:15.68]	Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
[05:20.93]	Put not another sin upon my head,
[05:25.02]	By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
[05:28.91]	By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
[05:33.85]	For I come hither arm'd against myself:
[05:38.58]	Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
[05:43.41]	A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
[05:47.82]PARIS	I do defy thy conjurations,
[05:51.29]	And apprehend thee for a felon here.
[05:55.70]ROMEO	Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
[06:00.85]	[They fight]
[06:02.11]PAGE	O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
[06:07.26]	[Exit]
[06:08.52]PARIS	O, I am slain!
[06:10.51]	[Falls]
[06:11.77]	If thou be merciful,
[06:14.50]	Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
[06:18.60]	[Dies]
[06:19.86]ROMEO	In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
[06:24.69]	Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
[06:29.32]	What said my man, when my betossed soul
[06:34.04]	Did not attend him as we rode? I think
[06:38.67]	He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
[06:43.92]	Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
[06:48.33]	Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
[06:53.06]	To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
[06:57.68]	One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
[07:02.83]	I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
[07:07.34]	A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
[07:12.28]	For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
[07:17.32]	This vault a feasting presence full of light.
[07:22.68]	Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
[07:27.93]	[Laying PARIS in the tomb]
[07:29.20]	How oft when men are at the point of death
[07:34.34]	Have they been merry! which their keepers call
[07:39.81]	A lightning before death: O, how may I
[07:44.32]	Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
[07:49.16]	Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
[07:54.72]	Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
[07:59.35]	Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
[08:04.49]	Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
[08:09.43]	And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
[08:14.68]	Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
[08:19.94]	O, what more favour can I do to thee,
[08:24.35]	Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
[08:30.02]	To sunder his that was thine enemy?
[08:34.33]	Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
[08:38.42]	Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
[08:43.36]	That unsubstantial death is amorous,
[08:47.77]	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
[08:52.71]	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
[08:57.23]	For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
[09:02.59]	And never from this palace of dim night
[09:07.42]	Depart again: here, here will I remain
[09:11.94]	With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
[09:17.29]	Will I set up my everlasting rest,
[09:21.50]	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
[09:26.43]	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
[09:32.32]	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
[09:37.46]	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
[09:43.03]	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
[09:47.76]	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
[09:52.70]	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
[09:57.53]	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
[10:02.57]	Here's to my love!
[10:05.09]	[Drinks]
[10:06.35]	O true apothecary!
[10:08.87]	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
[10:14.02]	[Dies]
[10:15.28]	[Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR
[10:15.91]	+ LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade]
[10:16.54]FRIAR LAURENCE	Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
[10:21.69]	Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
[10:27.36]BALTHASAR	Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
[10:33.04]FRIAR LAURENCE	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
[10:37.97]	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
[10:43.54]	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
[10:48.48]	It burneth in the Capel's monument.
[10:52.79]BALTHASAR	It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
[10:57.83]	One that you love.
[11:00.35]FRIAR LAURENCE	Who is it?
[11:02.03]BALTHASAR	Romeo.
[11:03.29]FRIAR LAURENCE	How long hath he been there?
[11:06.86]BALTHASAR	Full half an hour.
[11:09.38]FRIAR LAURENCE	Go with me to the vault.
[11:12.54]BALTHASAR	I dare not, sir
[11:14.74]	My master knows not but I am gone hence;
[11:19.57]	And fearfully did menace me with death,
[11:24.30]	If I did stay to look on his intents.
[11:28.82]FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
[11:33.97]	O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
[11:38.48]BALTHASAR	As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
[11:43.32]	I dreamt my master and another fought,
[11:47.94]	And that my master slew him.
[11:51.51]FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo!
[11:52.77]	[Advances]
[11:54.03]	Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
[11:59.28]	The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
[12:03.80]	What mean these masterless and gory swords
[12:08.95]	To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
[12:13.99]	[Enters the tomb]
[12:15.25]	Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
[12:19.77]	And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
[12:25.02]	Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
[12:29.43]	The lady stirs.
[12:31.64]	[JULIET wakes]
[12:32.90]JULIET	O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
[12:37.42]	I do remember well where I should be,
[12:41.93]	And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
[12:46.03]	[Noise within]
[12:47.29]FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
[12:52.44]	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
[12:57.17]	A greater power than we can contradict
[13:01.89]	Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
[13:06.83]	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
[13:11.77]	And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
[13:16.60]	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
[13:20.59]	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
[13:25.95]	Come, go, good Juliet,
[13:28.68]	[Noise again]
[13:29.94]	I dare no longer stay.
[13:32.88]JULIET	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
[13:37.51]	[Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]
[13:38.77]	What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
[13:44.44]	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
[13:49.27]	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
[13:54.52]	To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
[13:59.15]	Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
[14:03.98]	To make die with a restorative.
[14:07.87]	[Kisses him]
[14:09.13]	Thy lips are warm.
[14:11.65]First Watchman	[Within] Lead, boy: which way?
[14:14.90]JULIET	Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
[14:20.16]	[Snatching ROMEO's dagger]
[14:21.42]	This is thy sheath;
[14:24.04]	[Stabs herself]
[14:25.30]	there rust, and let me die.
[14:28.67]	[Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies]
[14:29.93]	[Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS]
[14:31.19]PAGE	This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
[14:37.07]First Watchman	The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
[14:42.85]	Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
[14:47.58]	Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
[14:52.51]	And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
[14:57.35]	Who here hath lain these two days buried.
[15:02.28]	Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
[15:07.01]	Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
[15:12.05]	We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
[15:17.31]	But the true ground of all these piteous woes
[15:22.77]	We cannot without circumstance descry.
[15:27.39]	[Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR]
[15:28.65]Second Watchman	Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
[15:34.53]First Watchman	Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
[15:40.10]	[Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE]
[15:41.36]Third Watchman	Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
[15:46.82]	We took this mattock and this spade from him,
[15:52.18]	As he was coming from this churchyard side.
[15:57.33]First Watchman	A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
[16:01.85]	[Enter the PRINCE and Attendants]
[16:03.11]PRINCE	What misadventure is so early up,
[16:07.20]	That calls our person from our morning's rest?
[16:12.67]	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others]
[16:13.93]CAPULET	What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
[16:19.29]LADY CAPULET	The people in the street cry Romeo,
[16:23.59]	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
[16:28.32]	With open outcry toward our monument.
[16:32.84]PRINCE	What fear is this which startles in our ears?
[16:38.20]First Watchman	Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
[16:43.34]	And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
[16:47.96]	Warm and new kill'd.
[16:50.70]PRINCE	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
[16:56.37]First Watchman	Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
[17:01.62]	With instruments upon them, fit to open
[17:06.35]	These dead men's tombs.
[17:09.40]CAPULET	O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
[17:14.86]	This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
[17:20.01]	Is empty on the back of Montague,--
[17:24.10]	And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
[17:29.25]LADY CAPULET	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
[17:33.87]	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
[17:38.39]	[Enter MONTAGUE and others]
[17:39.65]PRINCE	Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
[17:44.06]	To see thy son and heir more early down.
[17:48.89]MONTAGUE	Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
[17:53.62]	Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
[17:59.30]	What further woe conspires against mine age?
[18:04.55]PRINCE	Look, and thou shalt see.
[18:07.70]MONTAGUE	O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
[18:12.53]	To press before thy father to a grave?
[18:17.15]PRINCE	Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
[18:22.09]	Till we can clear these ambiguities,
[18:26.50]	And know their spring, their head, their
[18:31.23]	true descent;
[18:33.23]	And then will I be general of your woes,
[18:38.06]	And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
[18:43.31]	And let mischance be slave to patience.
[18:48.04]	Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
[18:52.56]FRIAR LAURENCE	I am the greatest, able to do least,
[18:56.86]	Yet most suspected, as the time and place
[19:01.80]	Doth make against me of this direful murder;
[19:07.05]	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
[19:12.20]	Myself condemned and myself excused.
[19:16.61]PRINCE	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
[19:21.97]FRIAR LAURENCE	I will be brief, for my short date of breath
[19:27.22]	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
[19:31.64]	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
[19:36.89]	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
[19:42.35]	I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
[19:47.71]	Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
[19:52.96]	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
[19:58.53]	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
[20:03.47]	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
[20:08.61]	Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
[20:14.08]	To County Paris: then comes she to me,
[20:18.59]	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
[20:23.85]	To rid her from this second marriage,
[20:28.36]	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
[20:33.51]	Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
[20:38.03]	A sleeping potion; which so took effect
[20:42.76]	As I intended, for it wrought on her
[20:47.17]	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
[20:52.31]	That he should hither come as this dire night,
[20:57.78]	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
[21:03.03]	Being the time the potion's force should cease.
[21:08.60]	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
[21:13.33]	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
[21:18.05]	Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
[21:22.78]	At the prefixed hour of her waking,
[21:27.09]	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
[21:32.34]	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
[21:37.07]	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
[21:41.90]	But when I came, some minute ere the time
[21:46.84]	Of her awaking, here untimely lay
[21:50.93]	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
[21:55.35]	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
[22:00.28]	And bear this work of heaven with patience:
[22:05.43]	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
[22:10.68]	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
[22:15.83]	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
[22:20.66]	All this I know; and to the marriage
[22:25.08]	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
[22:29.91]	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
[22:34.64]	Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
[22:39.47]	Unto the rigour of severest law.
[22:43.46]PRINCE	We still have known thee for a holy man.
[22:48.29]	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
[22:53.54]BALTHASAR	I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
[22:58.69]	And then in post he came from Mantua
[23:03.21]	To this same place, to this same monument.
[23:08.15]	This letter he early bid me give his father,
[23:13.40]	And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
[23:19.07]	I departed not and left him there.
[23:23.27]PRINCE	Give me the letter; I will look on it.
[23:27.79]	Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
[23:33.57]	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
[23:38.72]PAGE	He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
[23:44.28]	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
[23:48.70]	Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
[23:53.74]	And by and by my master drew on him;
[23:58.15]	And then I ran away to call the watch.
[24:02.77]PRINCE	This letter doth make good the friar's words,
[24:08.13]	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
[24:13.59]	And here he writes that he did buy a poison
[24:18.85]	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
[24:23.26]	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
[24:28.72]	Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
[24:33.55]	See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
[24:38.60]	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
[24:44.69]	And I for winking at your discords too
[24:49.42]	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
[24:54.88]CAPULET	O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
[24:59.29]	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
[25:04.44]	Can I demand.
[25:06.43]MONTAGUE	But I can give thee more:
[25:09.69]	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
[25:14.63]	That while Verona by that name is known,
[25:19.46]	There shall no figure at such rate be set
[25:24.50]	As that of true and faithful Juliet.
[25:28.92]CAPULET	As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
[25:33.75]	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
[25:37.53]PRINCE	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
[25:42.89]	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
[25:47.93]	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
[25:53.50]	Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
[25:58.44]	For never was a story of more woe
[26:02.64]	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
