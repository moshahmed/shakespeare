[00:00.37]	[A street.,]
[00:01.12]	[Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]
[00:01.88]MERCUTIO	Where the devil should this Romeo be?
[00:04.57]	Came he not home to-night?
[00:06.58]BENVOLIO	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
[00:09.53]MERCUTIO	Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
[00:13.11]	Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
[00:16.12]BENVOLIO	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
[00:18.63]	Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
[00:21.57]MERCUTIO	A challenge, on my life.
[00:23.39]BENVOLIO	Romeo will answer it.
[00:25.09]MERCUTIO	Any man that can write may answer a letter.
[00:28.16]BENVOLIO	Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
[00:31.42]	dares, being dared.
[00:32.93]MERCUTIO	Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
[00:36.44]	white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
[00:40.08]	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
[00:43.65]	blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
[00:46.92]	encounter Tybalt?
[00:48.36]BENVOLIO	Why, what is Tybalt?
[00:49.93]MERCUTIO	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
[00:53.31]	the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
[00:56.89]	you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
[01:00.03]	proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
[01:03.35]	the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
[01:06.93]	button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
[01:10.31]	very first house, of the first and second cause:
[01:13.64]	ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
[01:16.90]	hai!
[01:17.53]BENVOLIO	The what?
[01:18.47]MERCUTIO	The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
[01:21.35]	fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
[01:24.80]	a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
[01:28.07]	whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
[01:31.01]	grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
[01:34.40]	these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
[01:37.79]	perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
[01:41.11]	that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
[01:44.63]	bones, their bones!
[01:46.13]	[Enter ROMEO]
[01:46.88]BENVOLIO	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
[01:49.39]MERCUTIO	Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
[01:52.84]	how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
[01:56.29]	that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
[01:59.93]	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
[02:03.13]	be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
[02:06.27]	Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
[02:09.78]	eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
[02:12.73]	Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
[02:15.80]	to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
[02:19.19]	fairly last night.
[02:20.69]ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
[02:24.58]MERCUTIO	The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
[02:27.66]ROMEO	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
[02:31.17]	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
[02:34.43]MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
[02:37.69]	constrains a man to bow in the hams.
[02:40.33]ROMEO	Meaning, to court'sy.
[02:41.96]MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
[02:44.15]ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.
[02:46.29]MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
[02:48.86]ROMEO	Pink for flower.
[02:50.24]MERCUTIO	Right.
[02:50.99]ROMEO	Why, then is my pump well flowered.
[02:53.50]MERCUTIO	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
[02:56.95]	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
[03:00.46]	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
[03:04.60]ROMEO	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
[03:07.74]	singleness.
[03:08.81]MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
[03:11.94]ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
[03:15.71]MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
[03:19.09]	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
[03:22.73]	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
[03:26.12]	was I with you there for the goose?
[03:28.69]ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
[03:32.39]	not there for the goose.
[03:34.27]MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
[03:37.29]ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.
[03:39.17]MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
[03:42.49]	sharp sauce.
[03:43.62]ROMEO	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
[03:46.88]MERCUTIO	O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
[03:50.40]	inch narrow to an ell broad!
[03:52.53]ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
[03:55.98]	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
[03:59.62]MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
[04:03.13]	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
[04:06.58]	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
[04:09.90]	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
[04:13.35]	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
[04:17.43]BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.
[04:19.19]MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
[04:22.89]BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
[04:25.96]MERCUTIO	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
[04:29.29]	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
[04:32.74]	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
[04:36.00]ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!
[04:37.57]	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
[04:38.32]MERCUTIO	A sail, a sail!
[04:39.57]BENVOLIO	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
[04:41.71]Nurse	Peter!
[04:42.46]PETER	Anon!
[04:43.15]Nurse	My fan, Peter.
[04:44.34]MERCUTIO	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
[04:47.60]	fairer face.
[04:48.73]Nurse	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
[04:50.93]MERCUTIO	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
[04:53.38]Nurse	Is it good den?
[04:54.69]MERCUTIO	'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
[04:58.14]	dial is now upon the prick of noon.
[05:00.71]Nurse	Out upon you! what a man are you!
[05:03.10]ROMEO	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
[05:06.61]	mar.
[05:07.24]Nurse	By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
[05:10.56]	quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
[05:14.01]	may find the young Romeo?
[05:15.96]ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
[05:19.47]	you have found him than he was when you sought him:
[05:23.05]	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
[05:26.68]Nurse	You say well.
[05:27.88]MERCUTIO	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
[05:31.07]	wisely, wisely.
[05:32.33]Nurse	if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
[05:35.65]	you.
[05:36.28]BENVOLIO	She will indite him to some supper.
[05:38.85]MERCUTIO	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
[05:40.92]ROMEO	What hast thou found?
[05:42.62]MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
[05:45.88]	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
[05:49.33]	[Sings]
[05:50.08]	An old hare hoar,
[05:51.52]	And an old hare hoar,
[05:53.22]	Is very good meat in lent
[05:55.23]	But a hare that is hoar
[05:57.11]	Is too much for a score,
[05:58.99]	When it hoars ere it be spent.
[06:01.25]	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
[06:04.32]	to dinner, thither.
[06:05.83]ROMEO	I will follow you.
[06:07.33]MERCUTIO	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
[06:09.65]	[Singing]
[06:10.41]	'lady, lady, lady.'
[06:11.72]	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]
[06:12.48]Nurse	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
[06:15.42]	merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
[06:18.87]ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
[06:22.39]	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
[06:25.96]	to in a month.
[06:27.22]Nurse	An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
[06:30.48]	down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
[06:33.99]	Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
[06:37.44]	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
[06:40.77]	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
[06:44.15]	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
[06:47.85]PETER	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
[06:51.43]	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
[06:54.94]	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
[06:58.52]	good quarrel, and the law on my side.
[07:01.15]Nurse	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
[07:04.67]	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
[07:07.80]	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
[07:11.44]	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
[07:14.76]	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
[07:18.40]	a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
[07:21.98]	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
[07:25.43]	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
[07:28.88]	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
[07:32.39]	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
[07:35.34]ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
[07:38.48]	protest unto thee--
[07:39.98]Nurse	Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
[07:43.31]	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
[07:46.00]ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
[07:49.64]Nurse	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
[07:53.09]	I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
[07:55.66]ROMEO	Bid her devise
[07:56.98]	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
[08:00.12]	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
[08:03.19]	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
[08:06.39]Nurse	No truly sir; not a penny.
[08:08.33]ROMEO	Go to; I say you shall.
[08:10.09]Nurse	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
[08:13.16]ROMEO	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
[08:16.18]	Within this hour my man shall be with thee
[08:19.25]	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
[08:22.57]	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
[08:25.46]	Must be my convoy in the secret night.
[08:28.22]	Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
[08:31.29]	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
[08:33.93]Nurse	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
[08:36.94]ROMEO	What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
[08:39.26]Nurse	Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
[08:42.27]	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
[08:45.03]ROMEO	I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
[08:47.98]NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
[08:51.30]	Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
[08:54.57]	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
[08:57.95]	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
[09:01.28]	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
[09:04.54]	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
[09:08.05]	man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
[09:11.50]	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
[09:15.01]	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
[09:18.15]ROMEO	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
[09:20.85]Nurse	Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
[09:23.80]	the--No; I know it begins with some other
[09:26.68]	letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
[09:30.13]	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
[09:33.58]	to hear it.
[09:34.65]ROMEO	Commend me to thy lady.
[09:36.47]Nurse	Ay, a thousand times.
[09:38.10]	[Exit Romeo]
[09:38.85]	Peter!
[09:39.60]PETER	Anon!
[09:40.29]Nurse	Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
[09:43.30]	[Exeunt]
