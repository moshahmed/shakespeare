[00:00.42]	[Friar Laurence's cell.,]
[00:01.28]	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket]
[00:02.13]FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
[00:05.97]	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
[00:10.10]	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
[00:13.59]	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
[00:17.36]	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
[00:20.63]	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
[00:24.26]	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
[00:27.46]	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
[00:31.24]	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
[00:34.86]	What is her burying grave that is her womb,
[00:38.35]	And from her womb children of divers kind
[00:41.77]	We sucking on her natural bosom find,
[00:44.83]	Many for many virtues excellent,
[00:47.53]	None but for some and yet all different.
[00:50.81]	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
[00:54.15]	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
[00:57.99]	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
[01:01.76]	But to the earth some special good doth give,
[01:05.39]	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
[01:09.38]	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
[01:12.87]	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
[01:16.28]	And vice sometimes by action dignified.
[01:19.48]	Within the infant rind of this small flower
[01:23.04]	Poison hath residence and medicine power:
[01:26.39]	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
[01:30.59]	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
[01:34.21]	Two such opposed kings encamp them still
[01:37.56]	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
[01:41.12]	And where the worser is predominant,
[01:44.11]	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
[01:47.81]	[Enter ROMEO]
[01:48.66]ROMEO	Good morrow, father.
[01:50.44]FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!
[01:51.65]	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
[01:54.85]	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
[01:58.05]	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
[02:01.19]	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
[02:04.74]	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
[02:08.23]	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
[02:12.00]	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
[02:16.06]	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
[02:19.26]	Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
[02:22.68]	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
[02:25.81]	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
[02:29.08]ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
[02:32.64]FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
[02:35.84]ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
[02:38.76]	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
[02:42.32]FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
[02:46.23]ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
[02:49.50]	I have been feasting with mine enemy,
[02:52.56]	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
[02:55.70]	That's by me wounded: both our remedies
[02:58.90]	Within thy help and holy physic lies:
[03:01.96]	I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
[03:04.95]	My intercession likewise steads my foe.
[03:08.15]FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
[03:11.56]	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
[03:15.27]ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
[03:18.97]	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
[03:22.03]	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
[03:25.23]	And all combined, save what thou must combine
[03:28.86]	By holy marriage: when and where and how
[03:32.13]	We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
[03:35.48]	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
[03:38.89]	That thou consent to marry us to-day.
[03:41.95]FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
[03:45.30]	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
[03:48.64]	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
[03:52.20]	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
[03:55.76]	Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
[03:58.46]	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
[04:01.95]	How much salt water thrown away in waste,
[04:05.29]	To season love, that of it doth not taste!
[04:08.64]	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
[04:12.27]	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
[04:15.75]	Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
[04:19.17]	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
[04:22.59]	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
[04:26.36]	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
[04:29.77]	And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
[04:33.76]	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
[04:37.53]ROMEO	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
[04:40.80]FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
[04:43.86]ROMEO	And bad'st me bury love.
[04:46.00]FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,
[04:47.49]	To lay one in, another out to have.
[04:50.34]ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
[04:53.75]	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
[04:57.38]	The other did not so.
[04:59.31]FRIAR LAURENCE	O, she knew well
[05:00.87]	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
[05:04.57]	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
[05:07.77]	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
[05:10.83]	For this alliance may so happy prove,
[05:13.89]	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
[05:17.52]ROMEO	O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
[05:20.73]FRIAR LAURENCE	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
[05:24.21]	[Exeunt]
