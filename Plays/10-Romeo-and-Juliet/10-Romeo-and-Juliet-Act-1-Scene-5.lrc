[00:00.47]	[A hall in Capulet's house.,]
[00:01.41]	[Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins]
[00:02.35]First Servant	Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
[00:06.66]	shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
[00:10.11]Second Servant	When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
[00:14.66]	hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
[00:18.66]First Servant	Away with the joint-stools, remove the
[00:22.11]	court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
[00:26.34]	me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
[00:30.73]	the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
[00:34.65]	Antony, and Potpan!
[00:36.53]Second Servant	Ay, boy, ready.
[00:38.02]First Servant	You are looked for and called for, asked for and
[00:42.26]	sought for, in the great chamber.
[00:45.24]Second Servant	We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
[00:49.47]	brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
[00:53.31]	[Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house,
[00:53.79]	+ meeting the Guests and Maskers]
[00:54.26]CAPULET	Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
[00:58.33]	Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
[01:02.49]	Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
[01:05.86]	Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
[01:09.86]	She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
[01:14.09]	Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
[01:17.54]	That I have worn a visor and could tell
[01:21.15]	A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
[01:24.68]	Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
[01:28.91]	You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
[01:32.99]	A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
[01:36.75]	[Music plays, and they dance]
[01:37.70]	More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
[01:41.69]	And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
[01:45.77]	Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
[01:49.77]	Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
[01:53.06]	For you and I are past our dancing days:
[01:56.67]	How long is't now since last yourself and I
[02:00.59]	Were in a mask?
[02:02.24]Second Capulet	By'r lady, thirty years.
[02:04.51]CAPULET	What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
[02:08.20]	'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
[02:11.41]	Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
[02:14.78]	Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
[02:18.86]Second Capulet	'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
[02:22.39]	His son is thirty.
[02:24.27]CAPULET	Will you tell me that?
[02:26.47]	His son was but a ward two years ago.
[02:29.84]ROMEO	[To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
[02:33.05]	enrich the hand
[02:34.78]	Of yonder knight?
[02:36.58]Servant	I know not, sir.
[02:38.23]ROMEO	O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
[02:42.15]	It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
[02:45.99]	Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
[02:49.44]	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
[02:53.28]	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
[02:57.05]	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
[03:00.50]	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
[03:04.65]	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
[03:08.57]	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
[03:12.57]	For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
[03:16.49]TYBALT	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
[03:20.02]	Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
[03:23.94]	Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
[03:27.47]	To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
[03:30.76]	Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
[03:34.21]	To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
[03:37.74]CAPULET	Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
[03:41.58]TYBALT	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
[03:44.64]	A villain that is hither come in spite,
[03:48.17]	To scorn at our solemnity this night.
[03:51.54]CAPULET	Young Romeo is it?
[03:53.42]TYBALT	'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
[03:55.93]CAPULET	Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
[03:59.38]	He bears him like a portly gentleman;
[04:02.76]	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
[04:06.13]	To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
[04:09.81]	I would not for the wealth of all the town
[04:13.65]	Here in my house do him disparagement:
[04:17.11]	Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
[04:20.79]	It is my will, the which if thou respect,
[04:24.40]	Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
[04:28.47]	And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
[04:32.08]TYBALT	It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
[04:35.61]	I'll not endure him.
[04:37.65]CAPULET	He shall be endured:
[04:39.69]	What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
[04:43.14]	Am I the master here, or you? go to.
[04:46.27]	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
[04:50.27]	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
[04:53.64]	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
[04:57.49]TYBALT	Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
[04:59.68]CAPULET	Go to, go to;
[05:01.09]	You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
[05:04.31]	This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
[05:08.54]	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
[05:11.84]	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
[05:15.52]	Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
[05:19.44]	I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
[05:23.28]TYBALT	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
[05:27.28]	Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
[05:31.75]	I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
[05:35.44]	Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
[05:39.12]	[Exit]
[05:40.06]ROMEO	[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
[05:43.98]	This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
[05:47.67]	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
[05:51.43]	To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
[05:55.51]JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
[05:59.51]	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
[06:02.96]	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
[06:07.43]	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
[06:10.88]ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
[06:14.64]JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
[06:18.64]ROMEO	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
[06:22.56]	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
[06:26.80]JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
[06:31.11]ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
[06:35.19]	Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
[06:39.11]JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
[06:43.18]ROMEO	Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
[06:47.03]	Give me my sin again.
[06:49.14]JULIET	You kiss by the book.
[06:51.26]Nurse	Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
[06:54.95]ROMEO	What is her mother?
[06:56.91]Nurse	Marry, bachelor,
[06:58.55]	Her mother is the lady of the house,
[07:01.85]	And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
[07:05.45]	I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
[07:09.45]	I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
[07:12.98]	Shall have the chinks.
[07:15.18]ROMEO	Is she a Capulet?
[07:16.98]	O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
[07:20.59]BENVOLIO	Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
[07:23.96]ROMEO	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
[07:27.17]CAPULET	Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
[07:30.55]	We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
[07:34.39]	Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
[07:37.92]	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
[07:41.52]	More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
[07:45.44]	Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
[07:48.58]	I'll to my rest.
[07:50.30]	[Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse]
[07:51.25]JULIET	Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
[07:54.93]Nurse	The son and heir of old Tiberio.
[07:57.91]JULIET	What's he that now is going out of door?
[08:01.52]Nurse	Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
[08:04.89]JULIET	What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
[08:09.28]Nurse	I know not.
[08:10.61]JULIET	Go ask his name: if he be married.
[08:13.67]	My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
[08:17.12]Nurse	His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
[08:20.18]	The only son of your great enemy.
[08:23.24]JULIET	My only love sprung from my only hate!
[08:26.69]	Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
[08:30.45]	Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
[08:33.82]	That I must love a loathed enemy.
[08:36.88]Nurse	What's this? what's this?
[08:39.23]JULIET	A rhyme I learn'd even now
[08:41.82]	Of one I danced withal.
[08:44.09]	[One calls within 'Juliet.']
[08:45.04]Nurse	Anon, anon!
[08:46.29]	Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
[08:50.13]	[Exeunt]
