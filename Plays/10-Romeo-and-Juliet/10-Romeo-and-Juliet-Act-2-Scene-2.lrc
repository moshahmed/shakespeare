[00:00.44]	[Capulet's orchard.,]
[00:01.32]	[Enter ROMEO]
[00:02.20]ROMEO	He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
[00:05.73]	[JULIET appears above at a window]
[00:06.61]	But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
[00:10.65]	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
[00:13.81]	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
[00:17.26]	Who is already sick and pale with grief,
[00:20.64]	That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
[00:24.46]	Be not her maid, since she is envious;
[00:27.62]	Her vestal livery is but sick and green
[00:31.00]	And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
[00:34.53]	It is my lady, O, it is my love!
[00:37.17]	O, that she knew she were!
[00:39.45]	She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
[00:43.20]	Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
[00:46.28]	I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
[00:49.59]	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
[00:53.19]	Having some business, do entreat her eyes
[00:56.64]	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
[01:00.39]	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
[01:04.13]	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
[01:08.40]	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
[01:12.00]	Would through the airy region stream so bright
[01:15.89]	That birds would sing and think it were not night.
[01:20.00]	See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
[01:23.53]	O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
[01:26.69]	That I might touch that cheek!
[01:29.33]JULIET	Ay me!
[01:30.22]ROMEO	She speaks:
[01:31.47]	O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
[01:34.85]	As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
[01:38.59]	As is a winged messenger of heaven
[01:41.60]	Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
[01:44.91]	Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
[01:48.36]	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
[01:51.82]	And sails upon the bosom of the air.
[01:54.90]JULIET	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
[01:58.21]	Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
[02:01.29]	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
[02:04.75]	And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
[02:07.54]ROMEO	[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
[02:11.58]JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
[02:14.52]	Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
[02:17.83]	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
[02:21.20]	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
[02:24.29]	Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
[02:27.67]	What's in a name? that which we call a rose
[02:31.27]	By any other name would smell as sweet;
[02:34.58]	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
[02:37.96]	Retain that dear perfection which he owes
[02:41.48]	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
[02:44.79]	And for that name which is no part of thee
[02:48.39]	Take all myself.
[02:50.01]ROMEO	I take thee at thy word:
[02:52.21]	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
[02:55.74]	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
[02:58.60]JULIET	What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
[03:02.57]	So stumblest on my counsel?
[03:04.99]ROMEO	By a name
[03:06.17]	I know not how to tell thee who I am:
[03:09.33]	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
[03:12.71]	Because it is an enemy to thee;
[03:15.43]	Had I it written, I would tear the word.
[03:18.73]JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
[03:22.33]	Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
[03:26.30]	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
[03:29.24]ROMEO	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
[03:32.76]JULIET	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
[03:36.51]	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
[03:40.26]	And the place death, considering who thou art,
[03:44.01]	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
[03:47.09]ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
[03:51.43]	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
[03:54.66]	And what love can do that dares love attempt;
[03:58.41]	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
[04:01.71]JULIET	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
[04:05.24]ROMEO	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
[04:08.69]	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
[04:12.66]	And I am proof against their enmity.
[04:15.75]JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.
[04:19.49]ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
[04:23.53]	And but thou love me, let them find me here:
[04:27.13]	My life were better ended by their hate,
[04:30.51]	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
[04:33.97]JULIET	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
[04:37.93]ROMEO	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
[04:41.53]	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
[04:44.84]	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
[04:47.85]	As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
[04:51.82]	I would adventure for such merchandise.
[04:55.13]JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
[04:58.87]	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
[05:02.47]	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
[05:06.51]	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
[05:10.04]	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
[05:13.57]	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
[05:17.09]	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
[05:20.91]	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
[05:24.51]	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
[05:27.60]	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
[05:31.13]	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
[05:34.58]	I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
[05:38.18]	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
[05:41.85]	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
[05:45.01]	And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
[05:48.91]	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
[05:52.58]	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
[05:56.55]	I should have been more strange, I must confess,
[06:00.44]	But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
[06:03.97]	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
[06:07.57]	And not impute this yielding to light love,
[06:11.17]	Which the dark night hath so discovered.
[06:14.55]ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
[06:17.63]	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
[06:21.60]JULIET	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
[06:25.27]	That monthly changes in her circled orb,
[06:28.65]	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
[06:32.25]ROMEO	What shall I swear by?
[06:34.31]JULIET	Do not swear at all;
[06:36.22]	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
[06:39.82]	Which is the god of my idolatry,
[06:42.61]	And I'll believe thee.
[06:44.67]ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--
[06:46.87]JULIET	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
[06:50.33]	I have no joy of this contract to-night:
[06:53.71]	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
[06:57.09]	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
[07:00.91]	Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
[07:04.65]	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
[07:08.40]	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
[07:12.29]	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
[07:16.19]	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
[07:19.79]ROMEO	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
[07:22.87]JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
[07:26.47]ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
[07:30.51]JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
[07:34.34]	And yet I would it were to give again.
[07:37.57]ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
[07:41.46]JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.
[07:44.77]	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
[07:48.15]	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
[07:51.31]	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
[07:54.69]	The more I have, for both are infinite.
[07:57.92]	[Nurse calls within]
[07:58.80]	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
[08:02.25]	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
[08:05.56]	Stay but a little, I will come again.
[08:08.65]	[Exit, above]
[08:09.53]ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
[08:12.61]	Being in night, all this is but a dream,
[08:15.92]	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
[08:19.23]	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
[08:20.11]JULIET	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
[08:23.85]	If that thy bent of love be honourable,
[08:27.16]	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
[08:30.83]	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
[08:34.29]	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
[08:38.18]	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
[08:41.63]	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[08:45.38]Nurse	[Within] Madam!
[08:46.70]JULIET	I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
[08:50.16]	I do beseech thee--
[08:51.92]Nurse	[Within] Madam!
[08:53.24]JULIET	By and by, I come:--
[08:54.93]	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
[08:58.53]	To-morrow will I send.
[09:00.59]ROMEO	So thrive my soul--
[09:02.35]JULIET	A thousand times good night!
[09:04.85]	[Exit, above]
[09:05.73]ROMEO	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
[09:09.48]	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
[09:12.93]	their books,
[09:14.25]	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
[09:18.37]	[Retiring]
[09:19.25]	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
[09:20.13]JULIET	Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
[09:23.59]	To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
[09:26.82]	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
[09:30.34]	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
[09:33.94]	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
[09:37.84]	With repetition of my Romeo's name.
[09:40.85]ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:
[09:44.08]	How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
[09:47.98]	Like softest music to attending ears!
[09:51.14]JULIET	Romeo!
[09:52.02]ROMEO	My dear?
[09:53.05]JULIET	At what o'clock to-morrow
[09:55.40]	Shall I send to thee?
[09:57.38]ROMEO	At the hour of nine.
[09:59.29]JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
[10:02.89]	I have forgot why I did call thee back.
[10:06.20]ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.
[10:09.58]JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
[10:13.40]	Remembering how I love thy company.
[10:16.41]ROMEO	And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
[10:20.23]	Forgetting any other home but this.
[10:23.24]JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
[10:26.77]	And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
[10:30.15]	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
[10:33.46]	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
[10:36.98]	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
[10:40.66]	So loving-jealous of his liberty.
[10:43.52]ROMEO	I would I were thy bird.
[10:45.73]JULIET	Sweet, so would I:
[10:47.42]	Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
[10:51.09]	Good night, good night! parting is such
[10:54.32]	sweet sorrow,
[10:55.72]	That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
[10:59.54]	[Exit above]
[11:00.42]ROMEO	Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
[11:04.39]	Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
[11:08.21]	Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
[11:11.66]	His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
[11:15.19]	[Exit]
