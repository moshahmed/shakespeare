[00:00.40]	[A room in Capulet's house.,]
[00:01.22]	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS]
[00:02.04]CAPULET	Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
[00:05.18]	That we have had no time to move our daughter:
[00:08.73]	Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
[00:12.21]	And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
[00:15.21]	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
[00:18.62]	I promise you, but for your company,
[00:21.42]	I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
[00:24.29]PARIS	These times of woe afford no time to woo.
[00:27.49]	Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
[00:30.97]LADY CAPULET	I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
[00:34.18]	To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
[00:37.46]CAPULET	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
[00:40.66]	Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
[00:44.14]	In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
[00:47.69]	Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
[00:50.63]	Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
[00:53.70]	And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
[00:56.97]	But, soft! what day is this?
[00:59.16]PARIS	Monday, my lord,
[01:00.59]CAPULET	Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
[01:03.73]	O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
[01:06.93]	She shall be married to this noble earl.
[01:10.07]	Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
[01:13.28]	We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
[01:16.42]	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
[01:19.56]	It may be thought we held him carelessly,
[01:22.76]	Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
[01:25.56]	Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
[01:29.18]	And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
[01:32.73]PARIS	My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
[01:36.21]CAPULET	Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
[01:39.35]	Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
[01:42.14]	Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
[01:45.42]	Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
[01:48.56]	Afore me! it is so very very late,
[01:51.22]	That we may call it early by and by.
[01:54.08]	Good night.
[01:55.24]	[Exeunt]
