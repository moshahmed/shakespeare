[00:00.47]	[Capulet's orchard.,]
[00:01.42]	[Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window]
[00:02.38]JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
[00:06.11]	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
[00:09.76]	That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
[00:13.81]	Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
[00:17.62]	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
[00:21.19]ROMEO	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
[00:24.76]	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
[00:28.89]	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
[00:32.78]	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
[00:36.82]	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
[00:40.55]	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
[00:44.20]JULIET	Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
[00:47.78]	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
[00:51.35]	To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
[00:55.00]	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
[00:58.33]	Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
[01:02.54]ROMEO	Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
[01:06.11]	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
[01:09.52]	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
[01:13.41]	'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
[01:17.22]	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
[01:21.27]	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
[01:25.08]	I have more care to stay than will to go:
[01:28.81]	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
[01:32.62]	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
[01:36.43]JULIET	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
[01:39.68]	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
[01:43.41]	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
[01:47.62]	Some say the lark makes sweet division;
[01:51.19]	This doth not so, for she divideth us:
[01:54.61]	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
[01:58.81]	O, now I would they had changed voices too!
[02:02.62]	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
[02:06.67]	Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
[02:10.72]	O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
[02:14.69]ROMEO	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
[02:19.05]	[Enter Nurse, to the chamber]
[02:20.00]Nurse	Madam!
[02:20.96]JULIET	Nurse?
[02:21.91]Nurse	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
[02:25.80]	The day is broke; be wary, look about.
[02:29.13]	[Exit]
[02:30.08]JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
[02:33.74]ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
[02:37.70]	[He goeth down]
[02:38.66]JULIET	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
[02:42.70]	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
[02:46.67]	For in a minute there are many days:
[02:50.01]	O, by this count I shall be much in years
[02:53.74]	Ere I again behold my Romeo!
[02:56.44]ROMEO	Farewell!
[02:57.63]	I will omit no opportunity
[03:00.25]	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
[03:04.06]JULIET	O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
[03:07.79]ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
[03:11.91]	For sweet discourses in our time to come.
[03:15.64]JULIET	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
[03:18.82]	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
[03:22.39]	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
[03:25.72]	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
[03:29.85]ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
[03:33.34]	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
[03:36.99]	[Exit]
[03:37.95]JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
[03:41.84]	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
[03:45.72]	That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
[03:49.77]	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
[03:53.74]	But send him back.
[03:55.65]LADY CAPULET	[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
[03:58.42]JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
[04:02.15]	Is she not down so late, or up so early?
[04:05.73]	What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
[04:09.69]	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
[04:10.65]LADY CAPULET	Why, how now, Juliet!
[04:12.63]JULIET	Madam, I am not well.
[04:14.70]LADY CAPULET	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
[04:18.43]	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
[04:22.87]	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
[04:27.32]	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
[04:31.76]	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
[04:35.97]JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
[04:39.62]LADY CAPULET	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
[04:43.74]	Which you weep for.
[04:45.73]JULIET	Feeling so the loss,
[04:47.79]	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
[04:51.36]LADY CAPULET	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
[04:55.73]	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
[05:00.02]JULIET	What villain madam?
[05:02.00]LADY CAPULET	That same villain, Romeo.
[05:04.38]JULIET	[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
[05:08.27]	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
[05:11.76]	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
[05:15.73]LADY CAPULET	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
[05:19.62]JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
[05:23.43]	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
[05:27.64]LADY CAPULET	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
[05:31.61]	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
[05:35.65]	Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
[05:39.62]	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
[05:43.35]	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
[05:46.92]	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
[05:50.50]JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
[05:53.67]	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
[05:56.85]	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
[06:00.26]	Madam, if you could find out but a man
[06:03.75]	To bear a poison, I would temper it;
[06:07.00]	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
[06:10.58]	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
[06:14.39]	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
[06:18.12]	To wreak the love I bore my cousin
[06:21.37]	Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
[06:24.62]LADY CAPULET	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
[06:28.67]	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
[06:32.56]JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:
[06:36.21]	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
[06:39.71]LADY CAPULET	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
[06:43.59]	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
[06:47.17]	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
[06:50.50]	That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
[06:54.55]JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
[06:57.96]LADY CAPULET	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
[07:01.61]	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
[07:05.10]	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
[07:08.83]	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
[07:12.88]JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
[07:16.69]	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
[07:20.50]	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
[07:24.07]	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
[07:27.96]	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
[07:31.69]	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
[07:35.58]	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
[07:39.15]	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
[07:42.80]LADY CAPULET	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
[07:46.77]	And see how he will take it at your hands.
[07:50.58]	[Enter CAPULET and Nurse]
[07:51.54]CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
[07:55.42]	But for the sunset of my brother's son
[07:59.00]	It rains downright.
[08:00.98]	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
[08:04.87]	Evermore showering? In one little body
[08:08.36]	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
[08:12.01]	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
[08:15.98]	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
[08:20.27]	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
[08:24.47]	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
[08:28.52]	Without a sudden calm, will overset
[08:31.78]	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
[08:35.19]	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
[08:38.60]LADY CAPULET	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
[08:42.73]	I would the fool were married to her grave!
[08:46.62]CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
[08:50.59]	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
[08:54.71]	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
[08:58.84]	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
[09:02.49]	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
[09:06.38]JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
[09:10.51]	Proud can I never be of what I hate;
[09:13.84]	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
[09:17.97]CAPULET	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
[09:21.62]	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
[09:25.43]	And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
[09:28.92]	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
[09:32.97]	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
[09:37.34]	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
[09:41.07]	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
[09:44.72]	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
[09:48.92]	You tallow-face!
[09:50.67]LADY CAPULET	Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
[09:53.13]JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
[09:56.62]	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
[10:00.43]CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
[10:04.32]	I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
[10:08.53]	Or never after look me in the face:
[10:11.78]	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
[10:15.20]	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
[10:19.48]	That God had lent us but this only child;
[10:23.21]	But now I see this one is one too much,
[10:26.78]	And that we have a curse in having her:
[10:30.36]	Out on her, hilding!
[10:32.34]Nurse	God in heaven bless her!
[10:34.72]	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
[10:38.37]CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
[10:42.02]	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
[10:45.91]Nurse	I speak no treason.
[10:47.90]CAPULET	O, God ye god-den.
[10:49.72]Nurse	May not one speak?
[10:51.63]CAPULET	Peace, you mumbling fool!
[10:54.01]	Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
[10:57.66]	For here we need it not.
[11:00.04]LADY CAPULET	You are too hot.
[11:01.79]CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad:
[11:04.49]	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
[11:07.74]	Alone, in company, still my care hath been
[11:11.47]	To have her match'd: and having now provided
[11:15.44]	A gentleman of noble parentage,
[11:18.38]	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
[11:22.34]	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
[11:26.15]	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
[11:30.36]	And then to have a wretched puling fool,
[11:34.01]	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
[11:37.74]	To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
[11:41.15]	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
[11:44.49]	But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
[11:48.14]	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
[11:52.50]	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
[11:56.31]	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
[12:00.12]	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
[12:03.93]	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
[12:07.43]	the streets,
[12:08.86]	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
[12:12.74]	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
[12:16.55]	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
[12:20.52]	[Exit]
[12:21.48]JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
[12:25.05]	That sees into the bottom of my grief?
[12:28.54]	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
[12:31.79]	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
[12:35.36]	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
[12:38.78]	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
[12:42.35]LADY CAPULET	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
[12:46.08]	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
[12:49.89]	[Exit]
[12:50.84]JULIET	O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
[12:54.65]	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
[12:58.46]	How shall that faith return again to earth,
[13:02.35]	Unless that husband send it me from heaven
[13:06.24]	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
[13:09.81]	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
[13:14.34]	Upon so soft a subject as myself!
[13:17.43]	What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
[13:21.48]	Some comfort, nurse.
[13:23.46]Nurse	Faith, here it is.
[13:25.29]	Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
[13:29.50]	That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
[13:33.70]	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
[13:37.35]	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
[13:41.40]	I think it best you married with the county.
[13:45.37]	O, he's a lovely gentleman!
[13:47.91]	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
[13:51.72]	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
[13:55.53]	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
[13:58.86]	I think you are happy in this second match,
[14:02.75]	For it excels your first: or if it did not,
[14:06.56]	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
[14:10.53]	As living here and you no use of him.
[14:13.94]JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?
[14:16.72]Nurse	And from my soul too;
[14:18.86]	Or else beshrew them both.
[14:21.40]JULIET	Amen!
[14:22.28]Nurse	What?
[14:23.15]JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
[14:27.12]	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
[14:30.21]	Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
[14:34.26]	To make confession and to be absolved.
[14:37.75]Nurse	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
[14:41.17]	[Exit]
[14:42.12]JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
[14:45.61]	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
[14:49.26]	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
[14:53.39]	Which she hath praised him with above compare
[14:57.52]	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
[15:00.93]	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
[15:04.90]	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
[15:08.31]	If all else fail, myself have power to die.
[15:12.12]	[Exit]
