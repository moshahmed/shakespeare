[00:00.42]	[A public place.,]
[00:01.27]	[Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants]
[00:02.13]BENVOLIO	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
[00:05.32]	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
[00:08.24]	And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
[00:11.65]	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
[00:15.56]MERCUTIO	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
[00:19.39]	enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
[00:23.44]	upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
[00:27.21]	thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
[00:31.19]	it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
[00:34.88]BENVOLIO	Am I like such a fellow?
[00:37.02]MERCUTIO	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
[00:40.85]	any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
[00:44.83]	soon moody to be moved.
[00:46.89]BENVOLIO	And what to?
[00:48.17]MERCUTIO	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
[00:51.94]	shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
[00:55.63]	thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
[00:59.68]	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
[01:03.52]	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
[01:07.64]	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
[01:11.69]	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
[01:15.60]	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
[01:19.72]	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
[01:23.77]	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
[01:27.82]	man for coughing in the street, because he hath
[01:31.59]	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
[01:35.50]	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
[01:39.48]	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
[01:43.24]	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
[01:47.15]	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
[01:49.78]BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
[01:53.62]	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
[01:58.52]MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!
[02:00.65]BENVOLIO	By my head, here come the Capulets.
[02:03.49]MERCUTIO	By my heel, I care not.
[02:05.48]	[Enter TYBALT and others]
[02:06.34]TYBALT	Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
[02:09.68]	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
[02:13.09]MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? couple it with
[02:16.85]	something; make it a word and a blow.
[02:19.84]TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
[02:23.67]	will give me occasion.
[02:25.66]MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?
[02:29.50]TYBALT	Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
[02:32.49]MERCUTIO	Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
[02:36.04]	thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
[02:40.09]	discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
[02:44.00]	make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
[02:46.55]BENVOLIO	We talk here in the public haunt of men:
[02:49.82]	Either withdraw unto some private place,
[02:53.09]	And reason coldly of your grievances,
[02:56.15]	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
[02:59.42]MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
[03:03.18]	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
[03:06.52]	[Enter ROMEO]
[03:07.37]TYBALT	Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
[03:11.00]MERCUTIO	But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
[03:14.69]	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
[03:18.53]	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
[03:22.08]TYBALT	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
[03:25.21]	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
[03:28.76]ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
[03:32.25]	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
[03:35.44]	To such a greeting: villain am I none;
[03:38.50]	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
[03:42.12]TYBALT	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
[03:45.32]	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
[03:49.09]ROMEO	I do protest, I never injured thee,
[03:51.93]	But love thee better than thou canst devise,
[03:55.48]	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
[03:58.96]	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
[04:02.23]	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
[04:05.00]MERCUTIO	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
[04:08.06]	Alla stoccata carries it away.
[04:10.62]	[Draws]
[04:11.47]	Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
[04:14.52]TYBALT	What wouldst thou have with me?
[04:17.15]MERCUTIO	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
[04:20.92]	lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
[04:24.83]	shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
[04:28.59]	eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
[04:32.64]	by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
[04:36.41]	ears ere it be out.
[04:38.19]TYBALT	I am for you.
[04:39.54]	[Drawing]
[04:40.39]ROMEO	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
[04:43.23]MERCUTIO	Come, sir, your passado.
[04:45.22]	[They fight]
[04:46.07]ROMEO	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
[04:49.20]	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
[04:52.54]	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
[04:55.95]	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
[04:59.01]	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
[05:01.28]	[TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies
[05:01.71]	+ with his followers]
[05:02.13]MERCUTIO	I am hurt.
[05:03.27]	A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
[05:06.40]	Is he gone, and hath nothing?
[05:08.81]BENVOLIO	What, art thou hurt?
[05:10.59]MERCUTIO	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
[05:14.07]	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
[05:17.62]	[Exit Page]
[05:18.48]ROMEO	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
[05:21.46]MERCUTIO	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
[05:25.16]	church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
[05:28.92]	me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
[05:32.83]	am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
[05:36.67]	both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
[05:40.36]	cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
[05:43.84]	rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
[05:47.33]	arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
[05:51.09]	was hurt under your arm.
[05:53.22]ROMEO	I thought all for the best.
[05:55.57]MERCUTIO	Help me into some house, Benvolio,
[05:58.34]	Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
[06:01.96]	They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
[06:05.37]	And soundly too: your houses!
[06:07.79]	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]
[06:08.64]ROMEO	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
[06:11.77]	My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
[06:15.04]	In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
[06:17.95]	With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
[06:21.36]	Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
[06:24.35]	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
[06:27.26]	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
[06:30.60]	[Re-enter BENVOLIO]
[06:31.45]BENVOLIO	O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
[06:34.44]	That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
[06:37.99]	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
[06:41.54]ROMEO	This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
[06:45.31]	This but begins the woe, others must end.
[06:48.58]BENVOLIO	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
[06:51.92]ROMEO	Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
[06:54.90]	Away to heaven, respective lenity,
[06:57.67]	And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
[07:00.73]	[Re-enter TYBALT]
[07:01.58]	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
[07:04.78]	That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
[07:08.40]	Is but a little way above our heads,
[07:11.39]	Staying for thine to keep him company:
[07:14.51]	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
[07:17.93]TYBALT	Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
[07:21.62]	Shalt with him hence.
[07:23.54]ROMEO	This shall determine that.
[07:25.81]	[They fight; TYBALT falls]
[07:26.67]BENVOLIO	Romeo, away, be gone!
[07:28.44]	The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
[07:31.50]	Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
[07:35.41]	If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
[07:38.46]ROMEO	O, I am fortune's fool!
[07:40.45]BENVOLIO	Why dost thou stay?
[07:42.23]	[Exit ROMEO]
[07:43.08]	[Enter Citizens, &c]
[07:43.93]First Citizen	Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
[07:47.06]	Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
[07:50.19]BENVOLIO	There lies that Tybalt.
[07:52.25]First Citizen	Up, sir, go with me;
[07:53.95]	I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
[07:57.15]	[Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their
[07:57.58]	+ Wives, and others]
[07:58.00]PRINCE	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
[08:01.41]BENVOLIO	O noble prince, I can discover all
[08:04.25]	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
[08:07.45]	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
[08:10.72]	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
[08:13.78]LADY CAPULET	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
[08:16.90]	O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
[08:20.67]	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
[08:24.08]	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
[08:27.42]	O cousin, cousin!
[08:28.98]PRINCE	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
[08:31.97]BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
[08:35.59]	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
[08:39.07]	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
[08:42.48]	Your high displeasure: all this uttered
[08:45.68]	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
[08:49.52]	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
[08:53.07]	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
[08:56.48]	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
[09:00.18]	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
[09:03.66]	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
[09:07.28]	Cold death aside, and with the other sends
[09:10.69]	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
[09:13.54]	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
[09:16.24]	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
[09:19.72]	his tongue,
[09:20.93]	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
[09:24.48]	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
[09:27.96]	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
[09:31.44]	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
[09:34.64]	But by and by comes back to Romeo,
[09:37.48]	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
[09:40.61]	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
[09:44.02]	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
[09:47.79]	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
[09:50.91]	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
[09:54.04]LADY CAPULET	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
[09:56.74]	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
[10:00.36]	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
[10:04.20]	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
[10:07.82]	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
[10:11.52]	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
[10:14.65]PRINCE	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
[10:17.35]	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
[10:20.97]MONTAGUE	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
[10:24.38]	His fault concludes but what the law should end,
[10:28.22]	The life of Tybalt.
[10:29.99]PRINCE	And for that offence
[10:31.91]	Immediately we do exile him hence:
[10:34.76]	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
[10:38.38]	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
[10:42.36]	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
[10:45.77]	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
[10:49.25]	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
[10:52.45]	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
[10:56.29]	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
[10:59.84]	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
[11:03.32]	Bear hence this body and attend our will:
[11:06.66]	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
[11:10.21]	[Exeunt]
