[00:00.41]	[Friar Laurence's cell.,]
[00:01.24]	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS]
[00:02.08]FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
[00:05.20]PARIS	My father Capulet will have it so;
[00:07.97]	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
[00:11.23]FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:
[00:14.42]	Uneven is the course, I like it not.
[00:17.26]PARIS	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
[00:20.59]	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
[00:23.98]	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
[00:27.24]	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
[00:30.36]	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
[00:33.76]	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
[00:36.81]	To stop the inundation of her tears;
[00:39.72]	Which, too much minded by herself alone,
[00:42.84]	May be put from her by society:
[00:45.41]	Now do you know the reason of this haste.
[00:48.67]FRIAR LAURENCE	[Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
[00:52.48]	Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
[00:56.02]	[Enter JULIET]
[00:56.85]PARIS	Happily met, my lady and my wife!
[00:59.48]JULIET	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
[01:02.46]PARIS	That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
[01:05.79]JULIET	What must be shall be.
[01:07.73]FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.
[01:09.68]PARIS	Come you to make confession to this father?
[01:13.07]JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.
[01:16.19]PARIS	Do not deny to him that you love me.
[01:19.10]JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.
[01:22.16]PARIS	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
[01:25.21]JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,
[01:28.12]	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
[01:31.79]PARIS	Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
[01:35.33]JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;
[01:38.59]	For it was bad enough before their spite.
[01:41.85]PARIS	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
[01:45.73]JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
[01:48.92]	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
[01:52.04]PARIS	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
[01:55.50]JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.
[01:58.42]	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
[02:01.26]	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
[02:04.38]FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
[02:07.71]	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
[02:10.83]PARIS	God shield I should disturb devotion!
[02:13.81]	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
[02:17.07]	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
[02:20.26]	[Exit]
[02:21.09]JULIET	O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
[02:24.49]	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
[02:28.23]FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
[02:31.07]	It strains me past the compass of my wits:
[02:34.40]	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
[02:37.94]	On Thursday next be married to this county.
[02:41.33]JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
[02:44.80]	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
[02:48.06]	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
[02:51.32]	Do thou but call my resolution wise,
[02:54.23]	And with this knife I'll help it presently.
[02:57.63]	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
[03:01.30]	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
[03:04.63]	Shall be the label to another deed,
[03:07.47]	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
[03:10.73]	Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
[03:14.06]	Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
[03:17.46]	Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
[03:20.58]	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
[03:23.97]	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
[03:27.09]	Which the commission of thy years and art
[03:30.42]	Could to no issue of true honour bring.
[03:33.54]	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
[03:36.59]	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
[03:39.92]FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
[03:42.97]	Which craves as desperate an execution.
[03:46.09]	As that is desperate which we would prevent.
[03:49.56]	If, rather than to marry County Paris,
[03:52.54]	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
[03:56.21]	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
[03:59.26]	A thing like death to chide away this shame,
[04:02.73]	That copest with death himself to scape from it:
[04:06.48]	And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
[04:09.73]JULIET	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
[04:12.78]	From off the battlements of yonder tower;
[04:16.04]	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
[04:19.23]	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
[04:22.91]	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
[04:25.96]	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
[04:29.84]	With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
[04:33.38]	Or bid me go into a new-made grave
[04:36.22]	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
[04:39.55]	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
[04:43.50]	And I will do it without fear or doubt,
[04:46.62]	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
[04:50.02]FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
[04:53.21]	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
[04:56.26]	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
[04:59.52]	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
[05:03.19]	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
[05:06.24]	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
[05:09.50]	When presently through all thy veins shall run
[05:13.17]	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
[05:16.22]	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
[05:19.69]	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
[05:23.30]	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
[05:26.76]	To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
[05:29.68]	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
[05:33.14]	Each part, deprived of supple government,
[05:36.33]	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
[05:40.14]	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
[05:43.75]	Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
[05:46.94]	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
[05:50.13]	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
[05:53.66]	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
[05:57.34]	Then, as the manner of our country is,
[06:00.32]	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
[06:03.51]	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
[06:07.18]	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
[06:10.51]	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
[06:13.84]	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
[06:17.10]	And hither shall he come: and he and I
[06:20.15]	Will watch thy waking, and that very night
[06:23.48]	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
[06:26.53]	And this shall free thee from this present shame;
[06:30.34]	If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
[06:33.46]	Abate thy valour in the acting it.
[06:36.24]JULIET	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
[06:39.29]FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
[06:42.68]	In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
[06:46.22]	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
[06:49.27]JULIET	Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
[06:53.36]	Farewell, dear father!
[06:55.23]	[Exeunt]
