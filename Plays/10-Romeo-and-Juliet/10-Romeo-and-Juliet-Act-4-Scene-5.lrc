[00:00.57]	[Juliet's chamber.,]
[00:01.73]	[Enter Nurse]
[00:02.89]Nurse	Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
[00:08.59]	Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
[00:12.75]	Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
[00:17.48]	What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
[00:22.50]	Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
[00:27.52]	The County Paris hath set up his rest,
[00:31.77]	That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
[00:36.80]	Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
[00:41.14]	I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
[00:45.59]	Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
[00:49.93]	He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
[00:54.67]	[Undraws the curtains]
[00:55.83]	What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
[01:01.04]	I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
[01:05.20]	Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
[01:09.16]	O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
[01:13.02]	Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
[01:16.98]	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
[01:18.14]LADY CAPULET	What noise is here?
[01:20.55]Nurse	O lamentable day!
[01:22.77]LADY CAPULET	What is the matter?
[01:25.19]Nurse	Look, look! O heavy day!
[01:27.89]LADY CAPULET	O me, O me! My child, my only life,
[01:31.56]	Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
[01:35.91]	Help, help! Call help.
[01:38.42]	[Enter CAPULET]
[01:39.58]CAPULET	For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
[01:44.60]Nurse	She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
[01:49.53]LADY CAPULET	Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
[01:54.65]CAPULET	Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
[01:58.90]	Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
[02:03.92]	Life and these lips have long been separated:
[02:08.85]	Death lies on her like an untimely frost
[02:13.39]	Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
[02:18.03]Nurse	O lamentable day!
[02:20.25]LADY CAPULET	O woful time!
[02:22.08]CAPULET	Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
[02:27.30]	Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
[02:32.13]	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians]
[02:33.29]FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
[02:37.73]CAPULET	Ready to go, but never to return.
[02:41.40]	O son! the night before thy wedding-day
[02:45.75]	Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
[02:50.67]	Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
[02:54.73]	Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
[02:59.17]	My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
[03:03.42]	And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
[03:08.35]PARIS	Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
[03:13.47]	And doth it give me such a sight as this?
[03:18.01]LADY CAPULET	Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
[03:22.26]	Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
[03:26.61]	In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
[03:30.66]	But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
[03:35.40]	But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
[03:39.74]	And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
[03:44.77]Nurse	O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
[03:48.24]	Most lamentable day, most woful day,
[03:52.20]	That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
[03:55.87]	O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
[03:59.54]	Never was seen so black a day as this:
[04:03.79]	O woful day, O woful day!
[04:06.69]PARIS	Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
[04:11.04]	Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
[04:15.39]	By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
[04:19.54]	O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
[04:24.08]CAPULET	Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
[04:28.72]	Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
[04:33.06]	To murder, murder our solemnity?
[04:36.64]	O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
[04:41.18]	Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
[04:45.33]	And with my child my joys are buried.
[04:49.48]FRIAR LAURENCE	Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
[04:54.51]	In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
[04:58.95]	Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
[05:04.07]	And all the better is it for the maid:
[05:08.32]	Your part in her you could not keep from death,
[05:13.44]	But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
[05:18.07]	The most you sought was her promotion;
[05:22.32]	For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
[05:27.15]	And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
[05:31.50]	Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
[05:36.14]	O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
[05:40.77]	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
[05:45.31]	She's not well married that lives married long;
[05:50.43]	But she's best married that dies married young.
[05:55.55]	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
[06:00.19]	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
[06:04.63]	In all her best array bear her to church:
[06:09.17]	For though fond nature bids us an lament,
[06:13.71]	Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
[06:18.35]CAPULET	All things that we ordained festival,
[06:22.50]	Turn from their office to black funeral;
[06:26.95]	Our instruments to melancholy bells,
[06:31.00]	Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
[06:35.45]	Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
[06:39.99]	Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
[06:44.81]	And all things change them to the contrary.
[06:49.55]FRIAR LAURENCE	Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
[06:53.60]	And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
[06:57.57]	To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
[07:02.11]	The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
[07:06.74]	Move them no more by crossing their high will.
[07:11.76]	[Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE]
[07:12.92]First Musician	Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
[07:17.56]Nurse	Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
[07:21.62]	For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
[07:26.16]	[Exit]
[07:27.32]First Musician	Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
[07:31.66]	[Enter PETER]
[07:32.82]PETER	Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
[07:37.55]	ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
[07:42.96]First Musician	Why 'Heart's ease?'
[07:45.19]PETER	O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
[07:50.11]	heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
[07:55.23]	to comfort me.
[07:57.16]First Musician	Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
[08:01.41]PETER	You will not, then?
[08:03.73]First Musician	No.
[08:04.60]PETER	I will then give it you soundly.
[08:08.27]First Musician	What will you give us?
[08:10.98]PETER	No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
[08:14.94]	I will give you the minstrel.
[08:18.32]First Musician	Then I will give you the serving-creature.
[08:22.95]PETER	Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
[08:28.27]	your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
[08:33.48]	I'll fa you; do you note me?
[08:36.67]First Musician	An you re us and fa us, you note us.
[08:40.63]Second Musician	Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
[08:45.94]PETER	Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
[08:51.25]	with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
[08:56.66]	me like men:
[08:58.40]	'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
[09:02.85]	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
[09:06.81]	Then music with her silver sound'--
[09:10.57]	why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
[09:15.31]	sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
[09:19.07]Musician	Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
[09:23.90]PETER	Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
[09:27.57]Second Musician	I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
[09:33.37]PETER	Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
[09:37.81]Third Musician	Faith, I know not what to say.
[09:41.19]PETER	O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
[09:46.41]	for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
[09:51.05]	because musicians have no gold for sounding:
[09:55.88]	'Then music with her silver sound
[09:59.64]	With speedy help doth lend redress.'
[10:03.60]	[Exit]
[10:04.76]First Musician	What a pestilent knave is this same!
[10:08.82]Second Musician	Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
[10:13.94]	mourners, and stay dinner.
[10:16.93]	[Exeunt]
