[00:00.48]	[A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.,]
[00:01.44]	[Enter ROMEO]
[00:02.41]ROMEO	Can I go forward when my heart is here?
[00:06.03]	Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
[00:10.14]	[He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it]
[00:11.10]	[Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]
[00:12.07]BENVOLIO	Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
[00:14.32]MERCUTIO	He is wise;
[00:15.69]	And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
[00:19.55]BENVOLIO	He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
[00:23.66]	Call, good Mercutio.
[00:25.67]MERCUTIO	Nay, I'll conjure too.
[00:27.84]	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
[00:31.14]	Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
[00:34.69]	Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
[00:38.31]	Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
[00:42.17]	Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
[00:45.79]	One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
[00:49.82]	Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
[00:53.36]	When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
[00:57.14]	He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
[01:01.25]	The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
[01:04.87]	I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
[01:08.65]	By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
[01:12.43]	By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
[01:16.94]	And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
[01:20.72]	That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
[01:24.35]BENVOLIO	And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
[01:28.05]MERCUTIO	This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
[01:31.67]	To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
[01:35.45]	Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
[01:39.64]	Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
[01:43.50]	That were some spite: my invocation
[01:46.80]	Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
[01:50.83]	I conjure only but to raise up him.
[01:54.13]BENVOLIO	Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
[01:58.07]	To be consorted with the humorous night:
[02:01.77]	Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
[02:05.72]MERCUTIO	If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
[02:09.58]	Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
[02:12.96]	And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
[02:17.15]	As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
[02:21.17]	Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
[02:24.55]	An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
[02:28.17]	Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
[02:31.88]	This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
[02:35.82]	Come, shall we go?
[02:37.67]BENVOLIO	Go, then; for 'tis in vain
[02:40.09]	To seek him here that means not to be found.
[02:44.11]	[Exeunt]
