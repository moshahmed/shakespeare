[00:00.47]	[Friar Laurence's cell.,]
[00:01.43]	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]
[00:02.38]FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
[00:06.44]	Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
[00:09.86]	And thou art wedded to calamity.
[00:12.88]	[Enter ROMEO]
[00:13.83]ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
[00:17.73]	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
[00:21.62]	That I yet know not?
[00:23.69]FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar
[00:25.20]	Is my dear son with such sour company:
[00:28.70]	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
[00:32.52]ROMEO	What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
[00:36.65]FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
[00:40.47]	Not body's death, but body's banishment.
[00:44.05]ROMEO	Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
[00:47.39]	For exile hath more terror in his look,
[00:50.97]	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
[00:54.86]FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished:
[00:58.20]	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
[01:02.10]ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,
[01:05.68]	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
[01:08.86]	Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
[01:12.68]	And world's exile is death: then banished,
[01:16.41]	Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
[01:20.47]	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
[01:24.37]	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
[01:28.34]FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
[01:31.60]	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
[01:36.05]	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
[01:39.87]	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
[01:44.09]	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
[01:47.82]ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
[01:51.56]	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
[01:55.30]	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
[01:58.80]	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
[02:02.46]	But Romeo may not: more validity,
[02:05.48]	More honourable state, more courtship lives
[02:09.37]	In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
[02:13.19]	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
[02:17.01]	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
[02:20.82]	Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
[02:24.16]	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
[02:28.22]	But Romeo may not; he is banished:
[02:31.32]	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
[02:35.22]	They are free men, but I am banished.
[02:38.56]	And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
[02:42.53]	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
[02:46.91]	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
[02:50.96]	But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
[02:54.06]	O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
[02:57.80]	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
[03:01.70]	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
[03:04.96]	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
[03:08.54]	To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
[03:11.96]FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
[03:15.85]ROMEO	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
[03:19.35]FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
[03:23.33]	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
[03:26.51]	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
[03:30.24]ROMEO	Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
[03:33.27]	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
[03:36.61]	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
[03:40.26]	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
[03:44.08]FRIAR LAURENCE	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
[03:47.58]ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
[03:51.87]FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
[03:55.45]ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
[03:59.75]	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
[04:03.40]	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
[04:06.74]	Doting like me and like me banished,
[04:10.08]	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
[04:15.01]	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
[04:18.43]	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
[04:21.93]	[Knocking within]
[04:22.89]FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
[04:26.62]ROMEO	Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
[04:30.60]	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
[04:34.58]	[Knocking]
[04:35.53]FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
[04:39.51]	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
[04:43.16]	[Knocking]
[04:44.12]	Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
[04:47.54]	What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
[04:51.04]	[Knocking]
[04:51.99]	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
[04:56.60]Nurse	[Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
[05:00.26]	my errand;
[05:01.53]	I come from Lady Juliet.
[05:03.92]FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.
[05:05.43]	[Enter Nurse]
[05:06.38]Nurse	O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
[05:09.56]	Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
[05:13.06]FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
[05:17.52]Nurse	O, he is even in my mistress' case,
[05:20.62]	Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
[05:23.80]	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
[05:27.22]	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
[05:31.35]	Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
[05:35.09]	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
[05:39.23]	Why should you fall into so deep an O?
[05:42.72]ROMEO	Nurse!
[05:43.68]Nurse	Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
[05:47.50]ROMEO	Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
[05:51.31]	Doth she not think me an old murderer,
[05:54.81]	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
[05:58.79]	With blood removed but little from her own?
[06:02.68]	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
[06:06.66]	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
[06:10.32]Nurse	O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
[06:14.21]	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
[06:18.19]	And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
[06:21.93]	And then down falls again.
[06:24.47]ROMEO	As if that name,
[06:26.22]	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
[06:29.56]	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
[06:33.38]	Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
[06:37.43]	In what vile part of this anatomy
[06:40.61]	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
[06:44.51]	The hateful mansion.
[06:46.58]	[Drawing his sword]
[06:47.53]FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:
[06:49.92]	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
[06:53.81]	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
[06:57.79]	The unreasonable fury of a beast:
[07:00.89]	Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
[07:03.91]	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
[07:07.49]	Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
[07:10.91]	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
[07:14.73]	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
[07:18.86]	And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
[07:22.60]	By doing damned hate upon thyself?
[07:25.78]	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
[07:30.31]	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
[07:34.85]	In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
[07:39.14]	Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
[07:43.43]	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
[07:46.85]	And usest none in that true use indeed
[07:50.43]	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
[07:54.65]	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
[07:58.07]	Digressing from the valour of a man;
[08:01.41]	Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
[08:04.98]	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
[08:09.52]	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
[08:13.18]	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
[08:16.67]	Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
[08:20.49]	Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
[08:23.83]	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
[08:27.81]	What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
[08:31.46]	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
[08:35.60]	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
[08:39.58]	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
[08:43.95]	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
[08:48.32]	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
[08:52.22]	A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
[08:56.20]	Happiness courts thee in her best array;
[08:59.85]	But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
[09:03.43]	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
[09:07.33]	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
[09:11.22]	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
[09:14.80]	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
[09:18.54]	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
[09:22.60]	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
[09:26.17]	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
[09:30.31]	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
[09:34.44]	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
[09:38.42]	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
[09:42.40]	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
[09:45.97]	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
[09:49.55]	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
[09:53.21]	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
[09:56.79]	Romeo is coming.
[09:58.54]Nurse	O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
[10:02.67]	To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
[10:06.33]	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
[10:09.99]ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
[10:13.65]Nurse	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
[10:17.31]	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
[10:21.12]	[Exit]
[10:22.08]ROMEO	How well my comfort is revived by this!
[10:25.65]FRIAR LAURENCE	Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
[10:30.19]	Either be gone before the watch be set,
[10:33.77]	Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
[10:37.74]	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
[10:41.48]	And he shall signify from time to time
[10:45.06]	Every good hap to you that chances here:
[10:48.72]	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
[10:52.85]ROMEO	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
[10:56.51]	It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
[11:01.12]	[Exeunt]
