[00:00.49]	[Mantua. A street.,]
[00:01.49]	[Enter ROMEO]
[00:02.49]ROMEO	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
[00:06.72]	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
[00:10.79]	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
[00:14.86]	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
[00:18.69]	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
[00:23.26]	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
[00:27.08]	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
[00:31.06]	to think!--
[00:32.31]	And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
[00:36.63]	That I revived, and was an emperor.
[00:39.95]	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
[00:43.86]	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
[00:47.93]	[Enter BALTHASAR, booted]
[00:48.92]	News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
[00:52.33]	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
[00:56.65]	How doth my lady? Is my father well?
[01:00.06]	How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
[01:03.63]	For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
[01:07.28]BALTHASAR	Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
[01:11.11]	Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
[01:14.59]	And her immortal part with angels lives.
[01:18.42]	I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
[01:22.40]	And presently took post to tell it you:
[01:26.14]	O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
[01:29.96]	Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
[01:33.87]ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
[01:37.36]	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
[01:41.59]	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
[01:45.66]BALTHASAR	I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
[01:49.07]	Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
[01:53.14]	Some misadventure.
[01:55.13]ROMEO	Tush, thou art deceived:
[01:57.54]	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
[02:01.36]	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
[02:05.35]BALTHASAR	No, my good lord.
[02:07.18]ROMEO	No matter: get thee gone,
[02:09.67]	And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
[02:14.24]	[Exit BALTHASAR]
[02:15.24]	Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
[02:19.22]	Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
[02:23.54]	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
[02:27.53]	I do remember an apothecary,--
[02:30.36]	And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
[02:34.51]	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
[02:38.50]	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
[02:42.40]	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
[02:46.14]	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
[02:49.80]	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
[02:53.37]	Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
[02:57.44]	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
[03:00.76]	Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
[03:04.91]	Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
[03:09.23]	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
[03:13.06]	Noting this penury, to myself I said
[03:16.54]	'An if a man did need a poison now,
[03:19.87]	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
[03:23.52]	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
[03:27.84]	O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
[03:32.00]	And this same needy man must sell it me.
[03:35.82]	As I remember, this should be the house.
[03:39.56]	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
[03:43.38]	What, ho! apothecary!
[03:45.45]	[Enter Apothecary]
[03:46.45]Apothecary	Who calls so loud?
[03:48.44]ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
[03:52.35]	Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
[03:56.09]	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
[03:59.99]	As will disperse itself through all the veins
[04:04.31]	That the life-weary taker may fall dead
[04:08.13]	And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
[04:12.54]	As violently as hasty powder fired
[04:15.94]	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
[04:19.76]Apothecary	Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
[04:23.75]	Is death to any he that utters them.
[04:27.24]ROMEO	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
[04:31.23]	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
[04:35.30]	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
[04:39.37]	Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
[04:43.27]	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
[04:47.76]	The world affords no law to make thee rich;
[04:51.83]	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
[04:55.98]Apothecary	My poverty, but not my will, consents.
[04:59.47]ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
[05:02.88]Apothecary	Put this in any liquid thing you will,
[05:06.53]	And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
[05:10.77]	Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
[05:15.01]ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
[05:19.33]	Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
[05:23.40]	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
[05:28.13]	I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
[05:32.12]	Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
[05:36.19]	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
[05:39.93]	To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
[05:44.08]	[Exeunt]
