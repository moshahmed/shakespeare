[00:00.89]	[PROLOGUE]
[00:02.68]	Two households, both alike in dignity,
[00:09.09]	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
[00:15.65]	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
[00:22.51]	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
[00:29.96]	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
[00:37.56]	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
[00:45.32]	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
[00:52.03]	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
[00:59.78]	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
[01:07.68]	And the continuance of their parents' rage,
[01:14.84]	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
[01:23.33]	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
[01:30.49]	The which if you with patient ears attend,
[01:37.65]	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
