[00:00.38]	[A street.,]
[00:01.14]	[Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant]
[00:01.91]CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,
[00:04.52]	In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
[00:07.57]	For men so old as we to keep the peace.
[00:10.44]PARIS	Of honourable reckoning are you both;
[00:13.18]	And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
[00:16.05]	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
[00:18.98]CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:
[00:21.91]	My child is yet a stranger in the world;
[00:24.84]	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
[00:28.21]	Let two more summers wither in their pride,
[00:31.33]	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
[00:34.26]PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.
[00:37.19]CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
[00:40.38]	The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
[00:43.69]	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
[00:46.36]	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
[00:49.23]	My will to her consent is but a part;
[00:51.97]	An she agree, within her scope of choice
[00:54.90]	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
[00:57.89]	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
[01:00.95]	Whereto I have invited many a guest,
[01:03.62]	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
[01:06.49]	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
[01:09.61]	At my poor house look to behold this night
[01:12.73]	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
[01:16.24]	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
[01:19.17]	When well-apparell'd April on the heel
[01:22.03]	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
[01:25.15]	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
[01:28.40]	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
[01:31.14]	And like her most whose merit most shall be:
[01:34.32]	Which on more view, of many mine being one
[01:37.38]	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
[01:40.63]	Come, go with me.
[01:42.03]	[To Servant, giving a paper]
[01:42.80]	Go, sirrah, trudge about
[01:44.64]	Through fair Verona; find those persons out
[01:47.76]	Whose names are written there, and to them say,
[01:51.08]	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
[01:54.26]	[Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]
[01:55.02]Servant	Find them out whose names are written here! It is
[01:58.53]	written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
[02:02.09]	yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
[02:05.66]	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
[02:09.23]	sent to find those persons whose names are here
[02:12.67]	writ, and can never find what names the writing
[02:16.04]	person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
[02:20.06]	[Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]
[02:20.82]BENVOLIO	Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
[02:24.07]	One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
[02:27.13]	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
[02:30.25]	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
[02:33.81]	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
[02:36.74]	And the rank poison of the old will die.
[02:39.67]ROMEO	Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
[02:42.73]BENVOLIO	For what, I pray thee?
[02:44.45]ROMEO	For your broken shin.
[02:46.17]BENVOLIO	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
[02:48.02]ROMEO	Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
[02:51.01]	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
[02:53.88]	Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
[02:57.19]Servant	God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
[03:00.05]ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
[03:02.54]Servant	Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
[03:05.91]	pray, can you read any thing you see?
[03:08.59]ROMEO	Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
[03:11.65]Servant	Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
[03:14.00]ROMEO	Stay, fellow; I can read.
[03:15.85]	[Reads]
[03:16.62]	'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
[03:19.74]	County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
[03:23.30]	widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
[03:26.93]	nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
[03:30.31]	uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
[03:33.94]	Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
[03:37.32]	Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
[03:40.37]	assembly: whither should they come?
[03:42.92]Servant	Up.
[03:43.49]ROMEO	Whither?
[03:44.39]Servant	To supper; to our house.
[03:46.23]ROMEO	Whose house?
[03:47.38]Servant	My master's.
[03:48.53]ROMEO	Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
[03:51.65]Servant	Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
[03:55.21]	great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
[03:58.78]	of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
[04:02.28]	Rest you merry!
[04:03.62]	[Exit]
[04:04.38]BENVOLIO	At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
[04:07.31]	Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
[04:10.44]	With all the admired beauties of Verona:
[04:13.37]	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
[04:16.04]	Compare her face with some that I shall show,
[04:19.29]	And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
[04:22.41]ROMEO	When the devout religion of mine eye
[04:25.15]	Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
[04:28.72]	And these, who often drown'd could never die,
[04:31.90]	Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
[04:34.83]	One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
[04:37.95]	Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
[04:41.39]BENVOLIO	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
[04:44.32]	Herself poised with herself in either eye:
[04:47.38]	But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
[04:50.82]	Your lady's love against some other maid
[04:53.81]	That I will show you shining at this feast,
[04:56.93]	And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
[05:00.50]ROMEO	I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
[05:03.43]	But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
[05:06.29]	[Exeunt]
