[00:00.40]	[Capulet's orchard.,]
[00:01.20]	[Enter JULIET]
[00:02.00]JULIET	The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
[00:05.62]	In half an hour she promised to return.
[00:08.64]	Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
[00:11.98]	O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
[00:15.60]	Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
[00:19.35]	Driving back shadows over louring hills:
[00:22.43]	Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
[00:25.85]	And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
[00:29.33]	Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
[00:32.28]	Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
[00:35.90]	Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
[00:38.98]	Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
[00:42.26]	She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
[00:45.48]	My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
[00:48.69]	And his to me:
[00:50.03]	But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
[00:53.31]	Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
[00:56.19]	O God, she comes!
[00:57.67]	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
[00:58.47]	O honey nurse, what news?
[01:00.48]	Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
[01:03.63]Nurse	Peter, stay at the gate.
[01:05.57]	[Exit PETER]
[01:06.38]JULIET	Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
[01:10.06]	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
[01:13.21]	If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
[01:16.62]	By playing it to me with so sour a face.
[01:19.70]Nurse	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
[01:22.38]	Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
[01:25.87]JULIET	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
[01:29.15]	Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
[01:32.83]Nurse	Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
[01:35.91]	Do you not see that I am out of breath?
[01:38.93]JULIET	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
[01:42.61]	To say to me that thou art out of breath?
[01:45.76]	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
[01:49.18]	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
[01:52.33]	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
[01:55.34]	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
[01:58.56]	Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
[02:01.44]Nurse	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
[02:05.05]	how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
[02:08.60]	face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
[02:12.29]	all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
[02:15.84]	though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
[02:19.45]	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
[02:22.94]	but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
[02:26.55]	ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
[02:30.24]JULIET	No, no: but all this did I know before.
[02:33.12]	What says he of our marriage? what of that?
[02:36.33]Nurse	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
[02:39.55]	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
[02:42.83]	My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
[02:45.98]	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
[02:49.06]	To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
[02:52.41]JULIET	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
[02:55.62]	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
[02:59.38]Nurse	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
[03:02.86]	courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
[03:06.07]	warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
[03:09.16]JULIET	Where is my mother! why, she is within;
[03:12.04]	Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
[03:15.38]	'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
[03:18.47]	Where is your mother?'
[03:20.27]Nurse	O God's lady dear!
[03:21.88]	Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
[03:24.70]	Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
[03:27.84]	Henceforward do your messages yourself.
[03:30.86]JULIET	Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
[03:33.94]Nurse	Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
[03:37.15]JULIET	I have.
[03:38.03]Nurse	Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
[03:41.24]	There stays a husband to make you a wife:
[03:44.39]	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
[03:47.80]	They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
[03:51.09]	Hie you to church; I must another way,
[03:53.97]	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
[03:57.12]	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
[04:00.60]	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
[04:03.75]	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
[04:07.10]	Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
[04:10.04]JULIET	Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
[04:13.26]	[Exeunt]
