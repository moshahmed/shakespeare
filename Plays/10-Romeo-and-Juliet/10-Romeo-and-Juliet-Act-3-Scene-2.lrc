[00:00.48]	[Capulet's orchard.,]
[00:01.44]	[Enter JULIET]
[00:02.41]JULIET	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
[00:05.86]	Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
[00:09.48]	As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
[00:13.10]	And bring in cloudy night immediately.
[00:16.64]	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
[00:20.90]	That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
[00:24.51]	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
[00:28.37]	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
[00:32.15]	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
[00:36.01]	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
[00:39.95]	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
[00:43.49]	And learn me how to lose a winning match,
[00:47.27]	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
[00:51.20]	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
[00:55.14]	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
[00:59.73]	Think true love acted simple modesty.
[01:03.18]	Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
[01:07.28]	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
[01:11.14]	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
[01:14.76]	Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
[01:19.18]	Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
[01:22.80]	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
[01:26.58]	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
[01:30.60]	That all the world will be in love with night
[01:34.78]	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
[01:38.23]	O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
[01:41.77]	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
[01:45.63]	Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
[01:49.25]	As is the night before some festival
[01:52.71]	To an impatient child that hath new robes
[01:56.56]	And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
[02:00.58]	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
[02:05.01]	But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
[02:08.94]	[Enter Nurse, with cords]
[02:09.91]	Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
[02:14.49]	That Romeo bid thee fetch?
[02:17.06]Nurse	Ay, ay, the cords.
[02:18.83]	[Throws them down]
[02:19.80]JULIET	Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
[02:23.98]Nurse	Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
[02:28.00]	We are undone, lady, we are undone!
[02:31.13]	Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
[02:35.31]JULIET	Can heaven be so envious?
[02:37.81]Nurse	Romeo can,
[02:39.09]	Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
[02:42.39]	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
[02:45.84]JULIET	What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
[02:50.03]	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
[02:54.13]	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
[02:57.82]	And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
[03:01.52]	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
[03:05.30]	I am not I, if there be such an I;
[03:08.43]	Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
[03:12.37]	If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
[03:15.59]	Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
[03:19.37]Nurse	I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
[03:23.07]	God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
[03:27.01]	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
[03:30.62]	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
[03:34.40]	All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
[03:38.26]JULIET	O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
[03:42.36]	To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
[03:45.82]	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
[03:49.76]	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
[03:53.45]Nurse	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
[03:56.99]	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
[04:00.37]	That ever I should live to see thee dead!
[04:04.15]JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?
[04:08.01]	Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
[04:11.70]	My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
[04:15.40]	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
[04:19.50]	For who is living, if those two are gone?
[04:23.20]Nurse	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
[04:26.42]	Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
[04:29.87]JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
[04:33.81]Nurse	It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
[04:37.03]JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
[04:40.89]	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
[04:44.26]	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
[04:47.40]	Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
[04:51.34]	Despised substance of divinest show!
[04:54.71]	Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
[04:58.57]	A damned saint, an honourable villain!
[05:02.03]	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
[05:05.65]	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
[05:09.67]	In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
[05:13.20]	Was ever book containing such vile matter
[05:17.06]	So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
[05:21.00]	In such a gorgeous palace!
[05:23.57]Nurse	There's no trust,
[05:25.42]	No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
[05:29.12]	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
[05:32.82]	Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
[05:36.68]	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
[05:41.18]	Shame come to Romeo!
[05:43.27]JULIET	Blister'd be thy tongue
[05:45.68]	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
[05:49.46]	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
[05:53.00]	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
[05:57.10]	Sole monarch of the universal earth.
[06:00.47]	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
[06:03.93]Nurse	Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
[06:08.51]JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
[06:12.53]	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
[06:17.04]	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
[06:21.06]	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
[06:25.40]	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
[06:29.82]	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
[06:34.00]	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
[06:37.29]	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
[06:40.67]	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
[06:44.85]	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
[06:49.43]	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
[06:53.29]	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
[06:57.55]	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
[07:01.25]	But, O, it presses to my memory,
[07:04.15]	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
[07:08.00]	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
[07:11.22]	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
[07:14.68]	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
[07:18.94]	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
[07:22.39]	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
[07:25.93]	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
[07:29.95]	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
[07:34.05]	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
[07:37.51]	Which modern lamentations might have moved?
[07:41.45]	But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
[07:45.63]	'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
[07:49.08]	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
[07:52.54]	All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
[07:56.00]	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
[07:59.62]	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
[08:04.04]	Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
[08:07.66]Nurse	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
[08:11.35]	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
[08:15.45]JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
[08:20.12]	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
[08:24.06]	Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
[08:28.40]	Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
[08:31.69]	He made you for a highway to my bed;
[08:35.07]	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
[08:38.12]	Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
[08:42.22]	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
[08:45.84]Nurse	Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
[08:49.22]	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
[08:52.76]	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
[08:56.53]	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
[09:00.15]JULIET	O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
[09:04.17]	And bid him come to take his last farewell.
[09:08.11]	[Exeunt]
