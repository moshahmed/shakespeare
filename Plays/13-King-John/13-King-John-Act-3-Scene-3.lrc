[00:00.62]	[The same.,]
[00:01.88]	[Alarums, excursions, retreat. Enter KING JOHN,
[00:02.51]	+ QUEEN ELINOR, ARTHUR, the BASTARD, HUBERT,
[00:03.14]	+ and Lords]
[00:03.77]KING JOHN	[To QUEEN ELINOR] So shall it be; your grace shall
[00:08.39]	stay behind
[00:10.28]	So strongly guarded.
[00:13.00]	[To ARTHUR]
[00:14.26]	Cousin, look not sad:
[00:16.99]	Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will
[00:22.03]	As dear be to thee as thy father was.
[00:26.54]ARTHUR	O, this will make my mother die with grief!
[00:31.57]KING JOHN	[To the BASTARD] Cousin, away for England!
[00:35.35]	haste before:
[00:37.34]	And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
[00:42.48]	Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels
[00:46.99]	Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace
[00:51.50]	Must by the hungry now be fed upon:
[00:55.81]	Use our commission in his utmost force.
[01:00.53]BASTARD	Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,
[01:05.88]	When gold and silver becks me to come on.
[01:10.81]	I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,
[01:15.84]	If ever I remember to be holy,
[01:19.62]	For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.
[01:24.55]ELINOR	Farewell, gentle cousin.
[01:27.59]KING JOHN	Coz, farewell.
[01:29.59]	[Exit the BASTARD]
[01:30.84]QUEEN ELINOR	Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
[01:35.57]KING JOHN	Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
[01:40.18]	We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh
[01:45.32]	There is a soul counts thee her creditor
[01:50.25]	And with advantage means to pay thy love:
[01:55.18]	And my good friend, thy voluntary oath
[01:59.80]	Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
[02:04.31]	Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
[02:08.93]	But I will fit it with some better time.
[02:13.75]	By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed
[02:18.26]	To say what good respect I have of thee.
[02:23.09]HUBERT	I am much bounden to your majesty.
[02:27.28]KING JOHN	Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
[02:32.63]	But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
[02:38.40]	Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.
[02:43.44]	I had a thing to say, but let it go:
[02:47.74]	The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
[02:52.88]	Attended with the pleasures of the world,
[02:57.81]	Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
[03:02.64]	To give me audience: if the midnight bell
[03:07.57]	Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
[03:12.60]	Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
[03:17.32]	If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
[03:22.78]	And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
[03:27.82]	Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
[03:32.12]	Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
[03:37.36]	Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
[03:42.92]	Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
[03:48.06]	And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
[03:53.10]	A passion hateful to my purposes,
[03:57.19]	Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
[04:02.43]	Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
[04:07.47]	Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
[04:11.98]	Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
[04:17.33]	Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
[04:22.16]	I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
[04:26.98]	But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;
[04:31.70]	And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.
[04:36.95]HUBERT	So well, that what you bid me undertake,
[04:41.67]	Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
[04:46.92]	By heaven, I would do it.
[04:50.06]KING JOHN	Do not I know thou wouldst?
[04:53.52]	Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
[04:58.56]	On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
[05:04.12]	He is a very serpent in my way;
[05:08.00]	And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,
[05:13.25]	He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
[05:18.28]	Thou art his keeper.
[05:21.01]HUBERT	And I'll keep him so,
[05:23.84]	That he shall not offend your majesty.
[05:28.46]KING JOHN	Death.
[05:29.72]HUBERT	My lord?
[05:31.19]KING JOHN	A grave.
[05:32.65]HUBERT	He shall not live.
[05:35.17]KING JOHN	Enough.
[05:36.54]	I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;
[05:41.36]	Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:
[05:46.29]	Remember. Madam, fare you well:
[05:49.96]	I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.
[05:55.21]ELINOR	My blessing go with thee!
[05:58.46]KING JOHN	For England, cousin, go:
[06:01.40]	Hubert shall be your man, attend on you
[06:06.12]	With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!
[06:10.84]	[Exeunt]
