[00:00.52]	[The French camp.,]
[00:01.57]	[Enter LEWIS and his train]
[00:02.61]LEWIS	The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
[00:07.06]	But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
[00:11.51]	When English measure backward their own ground
[00:16.13]	In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
[00:19.97]	When with a volley of our needless shot,
[00:23.98]	After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
[00:28.08]	And wound our tattering colours clearly up,
[00:32.36]	Last in the field, and almost lords of it!
[00:36.46]	[Enter a Messenger]
[00:37.50]Messenger	Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
[00:40.73]LEWIS	Here: what news?
[00:42.56]Messenger	The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
[00:46.84]	By his persuasion are again fall'n off,
[00:50.76]	And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
[00:55.30]	Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.
[00:59.31]LEWIS	Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
[01:03.59]	I did not think to be so sad to-night
[01:07.42]	As this hath made me. Who was he that said
[01:11.61]	King John did fly an hour or two before
[01:15.62]	The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
[01:20.16]Messenger	Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
[01:23.82]LEWIS	Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
[01:28.36]	The day shall not be up so soon as I,
[01:32.11]	To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
[01:36.04]	[Exeunt]
