[00:00.38]	[A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.,]
[00:01.16]	[Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians]
[00:01.94]CORIOLANUS	Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
[00:05.24]	Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
[00:08.41]	Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
[00:11.32]	That the precipitation might down stretch
[00:14.42]	Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
[00:17.46]	Be thus to them.
[00:18.89]A Patrician	You do the nobler.
[00:20.44]CORIOLANUS	I muse my mother
[00:21.93]	Does not approve me further, who was wont
[00:24.97]	To call them woollen vassals, things created
[00:28.21]	To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
[00:31.63]	In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
[00:34.93]	When one but of my ordinance stood up
[00:37.78]	To speak of peace or war.
[00:39.79]	[Enter VOLUMNIA]
[00:40.56]	I talk of you:
[00:41.86]	Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
[00:45.16]	False to my nature? Rather say I play
[00:47.94]	The man I am.
[00:49.17]VOLUMNIA	O, sir, sir, sir,
[00:50.46]	I would have had you put your power well on,
[00:53.70]	Before you had worn it out.
[00:55.83]CORIOLANUS	Let go.
[00:56.68]VOLUMNIA	You might have been enough the man you are,
[00:59.85]	With striving less to be so; lesser had been
[01:03.08]	The thwartings of your dispositions, if
[01:05.99]	You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
[01:09.29]	Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
[01:11.95]CORIOLANUS	Let them hang.
[01:13.24]A Patrician	Ay, and burn too.
[01:14.66]	[Enter MENENIUS and Senators]
[01:15.44]MENENIUS	Come, come, you have been too rough, something
[01:18.67]	too rough;
[01:19.71]	You must return and mend it.
[01:21.91]First Senator	There's no remedy;
[01:23.46]	Unless, by not so doing, our good city
[01:26.24]	Cleave in the midst, and perish.
[01:28.64]VOLUMNIA	Pray, be counsell'd:
[01:30.26]	I have a heart as little apt as yours,
[01:33.10]	But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
[01:36.27]	To better vantage.
[01:37.83]MENENIUS	Well said, noble woman?
[01:39.64]	Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
[01:43.20]	The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
[01:46.63]	For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
[01:50.06]	Which I can scarcely bear.
[01:52.13]CORIOLANUS	What must I do?
[01:53.48]MENENIUS	Return to the tribunes.
[01:55.36]CORIOLANUS	Well, what then? what then?
[01:57.37]MENENIUS	Repent what you have spoke.
[01:59.50]CORIOLANUS	For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
[02:02.22]	Must I then do't to them?
[02:04.23]VOLUMNIA	You are too absolute;
[02:05.97]	Though therein you can never be too noble,
[02:09.08]	But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
[02:12.57]	Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
[02:15.61]	I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
[02:19.24]	In peace what each of them by the other lose,
[02:22.54]	That they combine not there.
[02:24.74]CORIOLANUS	Tush, tush!
[02:25.77]MENENIUS	A good demand.
[02:27.07]VOLUMNIA	If it be honour in your wars to seem
[02:29.85]	The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
[02:33.21]	You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
[02:36.58]	That it shall hold companionship in peace
[02:39.68]	With honour, as in war, since that to both
[02:42.72]	It stands in like request?
[02:44.79]CORIOLANUS	Why force you this?
[02:46.41]VOLUMNIA	Because that now it lies you on to speak
[02:49.45]	To the people; not by your own instruction,
[02:52.56]	Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
[02:55.99]	But with such words that are but rooted in
[02:59.16]	Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
[03:02.52]	Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
[03:05.37]	Now, this no more dishonours you at all
[03:08.28]	Than to take in a town with gentle words,
[03:11.32]	Which else would put you to your fortune and
[03:14.62]	The hazard of much blood.
[03:16.63]	I would dissemble with my nature where
[03:19.54]	My fortunes and my friends at stake required
[03:22.84]	I should do so in honour: I am in this,
[03:25.69]	Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
[03:28.99]	And you will rather show our general louts
[03:32.16]	How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
[03:35.39]	For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
[03:38.95]	Of what that want might ruin.
[03:41.22]MENENIUS	Noble lady!
[03:42.32]	Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
[03:45.55]	Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
[03:48.72]	Of what is past.
[03:50.15]VOLUMNIA	I prithee now, my son,
[03:51.89]	Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
[03:54.87]	And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
[03:58.56]	Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
[04:02.12]	Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
[04:05.67]	More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
[04:08.84]	Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
[04:12.08]	Now humble as the ripest mulberry
[04:14.67]	That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
[04:18.10]	Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
[04:21.59]	Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
[04:24.96]	Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
[04:28.06]	In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
[04:31.49]	Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
[04:34.53]	As thou hast power and person.
[04:36.86]MENENIUS	This but done,
[04:38.16]	Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
[04:41.58]	For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
[04:44.69]	As words to little purpose.
[04:46.83]VOLUMNIA	Prithee now,
[04:47.99]	Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
[04:51.61]	Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
[04:54.27]	Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
[04:57.57]	[Enter COMINIUS]
[04:58.34]COMINIUS	I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
[05:01.77]	You make strong party, or defend yourself
[05:04.81]	By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
[05:07.85]MENENIUS	Only fair speech.
[05:09.34]COMINIUS	I think 'twill serve, if he
[05:11.41]	Can thereto frame his spirit.
[05:13.68]VOLUMNIA	He must, and will
[05:15.17]	Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
[05:18.21]CORIOLANUS	Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
[05:21.12]	Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
[05:24.35]	A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
[05:27.39]	Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
[05:30.63]	This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
[05:34.32]	And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
[05:37.88]	You have put me now to such a part which never
[05:41.31]	I shall discharge to the life.
[05:43.63]COMINIUS	Come, come, we'll prompt you.
[05:45.77]VOLUMNIA	I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
[05:48.88]	My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
[05:51.85]	To have my praise for this, perform a part
[05:54.96]	Thou hast not done before.
[05:57.03]CORIOLANUS	Well, I must do't:
[05:58.52]	Away, my disposition, and possess me
[06:01.17]	Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
[06:04.66]	Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
[06:07.51]	Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
[06:10.42]	That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
[06:13.79]	Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
[06:17.22]	The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
[06:20.32]	Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
[06:23.75]	Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
[06:26.86]	That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
[06:30.03]	Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
[06:33.07]	And by my body's action teach my mind
[06:35.92]	A most inherent baseness.
[06:37.92]VOLUMNIA	At thy choice, then:
[06:39.54]	To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
[06:42.45]	Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
[06:45.36]	Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
[06:48.53]	Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
[06:51.77]	With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
[06:54.87]	Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
[06:58.50]	But owe thy pride thyself.
[07:00.57]CORIOLANUS	Pray, be content:
[07:01.99]	Mother, I am going to the market-place;
[07:04.84]	Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
[07:08.14]	Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
[07:11.70]	Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
[07:14.80]	Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
[07:17.84]	Or never trust to what my tongue can do
[07:20.82]	I' the way of flattery further.
[07:23.15]VOLUMNIA	Do your will.
[07:24.38]	[Exit]
[07:25.15]COMINIUS	Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
[07:28.45]	To answer mildly; for they are prepared
[07:31.37]	With accusations, as I hear, more strong
[07:34.28]	Than are upon you yet.
[07:36.09]CORIOLANUS	The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
[07:38.94]	Let them accuse me by invention, I
[07:41.52]	Will answer in mine honour.
[07:43.66]MENENIUS	Ay, but mildly.
[07:44.95]CORIOLANUS	Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
[07:47.28]	[Exeunt]
