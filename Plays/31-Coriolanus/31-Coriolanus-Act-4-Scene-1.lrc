[00:00.40]	[Rome. Before a gate of the city.,]
[00:01.22]	[Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS,
[00:01.63]	+ COMINIUS, with the young Nobility of Rome]
[00:02.04]CORIOLANUS	Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
[00:05.78]	With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
[00:08.99]	Where is your ancient courage? you were used
[00:12.39]	To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
[00:15.66]	That common chances common men could bear;
[00:18.93]	That when the sea was calm all boats alike
[00:22.27]	Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
[00:25.81]	When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
[00:29.62]	A noble cunning: you were used to load me
[00:32.82]	With precepts that would make invincible
[00:36.03]	The heart that conn'd them.
[00:38.27]VIRGILIA	O heavens! O heavens!
[00:40.04]CORIOLANUS	Nay! prithee, woman,--
[00:41.68]VOLUMNIA	Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
[00:45.42]	And occupations perish!
[00:47.40]CORIOLANUS	What, what, what!
[00:48.83]	I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
[00:52.30]	Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
[00:55.78]	If you had been the wife of Hercules,
[00:58.71]	Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
[01:02.25]	Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
[01:05.11]	Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
[01:08.45]	I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
[01:11.85]	Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
[01:15.12]	And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
[01:18.73]	I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
[01:22.34]	Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
[01:26.02]	'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
[01:28.88]	As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
[01:32.35]	My hazards still have been your solace: and
[01:35.69]	Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
[01:38.82]	Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
[01:41.75]	Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
[01:45.63]	Will or exceed the common or be caught
[01:48.70]	With cautelous baits and practise.
[01:51.42]VOLUMNIA	My first son.
[01:52.72]	Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
[01:55.85]	With thee awhile: determine on some course,
[01:59.12]	More than a wild exposture to each chance
[02:02.39]	That starts i' the way before thee.
[02:05.11]CORIOLANUS	O the gods!
[02:06.27]COMINIUS	I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
[02:09.54]	Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
[02:13.29]	And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
[02:16.62]	A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
[02:19.83]	O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
[02:23.03]	And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
[02:26.16]	I' the absence of the needer.
[02:28.48]CORIOLANUS	Fare ye well:
[02:29.77]	Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
[02:33.45]	Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
[02:36.65]	That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
[02:40.19]	Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
[02:43.39]	My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
[02:46.66]	Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
[02:49.93]	While I remain above the ground, you shall
[02:53.20]	Hear from me still, and never of me aught
[02:56.40]	But what is like me formerly.
[02:58.78]MENENIUS	That's worthily
[03:00.28]	As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
[03:03.42]	If I could shake off but one seven years
[03:06.62]	From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
[03:10.16]	I'ld with thee every foot.
[03:12.34]CORIOLANUS	Give me thy hand: Come.
[03:14.25]	[Exeunt]
