[00:00.27]	[The Roman camp.,]
[00:00.82]	[Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.
[00:01.09]	+ Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from
[00:01.36]	+ the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf]
[00:01.64]COMINIUS	If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
[00:04.05]	Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
[00:06.65]	Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
[00:09.02]	Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
[00:11.40]	I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
[00:13.86]	And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
[00:15.86]	dull tribunes,
[00:16.78]	That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
[00:19.29]	Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
[00:21.79]	Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
[00:23.39]	Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
[00:25.58]	Having fully dined before.
[00:27.04]	[Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power,
[00:27.31]	+ from the pursuit]
[00:27.59]LARTIUS	O general,
[00:28.31]	Here is the steed, we the caparison:
[00:30.18]	Hadst thou beheld--
[00:31.28]MARCIUS	Pray now, no more: my mother,
[00:32.78]	Who has a charter to extol her blood,
[00:34.74]	When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
[00:37.16]	As you have done; that's what I can; induced
[00:39.40]	As you have been; that's for my country:
[00:41.45]	He that has but effected his good will
[00:43.50]	Hath overta'en mine act.
[00:44.87]COMINIUS	You shall not be
[00:45.92]	The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
[00:48.15]	The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
[00:50.30]	Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
[00:52.67]	To hide your doings; and to silence that,
[00:54.76]	Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
[00:57.14]	Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
[00:59.51]	In sign of what you are, not to reward
[01:01.51]	What you have done--before our army hear me.
[01:03.75]MARCIUS	I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
[01:05.94]	To hear themselves remember'd.
[01:07.58]COMINIUS	Should they not,
[01:08.58]	Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
[01:10.77]	And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
[01:13.28]	Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
[01:15.79]	The treasure in this field achieved and city,
[01:18.11]	We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
[01:20.30]	Before the common distribution, at
[01:22.13]	Your only choice.
[01:23.18]MARCIUS	I thank you, general;
[01:24.36]	But cannot make my heart consent to take
[01:26.50]	A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
[01:28.56]	And stand upon my common part with those
[01:30.70]	That have beheld the doing.
[01:32.20]	[A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'
[01:32.48]	+ cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS
[01:32.75]	+ stand bare]
[01:33.03]MARCIUS	May these same instruments, which you profane,
[01:35.35]	Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
[01:37.77]	I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
[01:40.50]	Made all of false-faced soothing!
[01:42.28]	When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
[01:44.61]	Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
[01:46.75]	No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
[01:48.90]	My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
[01:51.31]	Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
[01:53.68]	You shout me forth
[01:54.82]	In acclamations hyperbolical;
[01:56.42]	As if I loved my little should be dieted
[01:58.56]	In praises sauced with lies.
[02:00.11]COMINIUS	Too modest are you;
[02:01.25]	More cruel to your good report than grateful
[02:03.58]	To us that give you truly: by your patience,
[02:05.81]	If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
[02:08.32]	Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
[02:10.79]	Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
[02:13.34]	As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
[02:15.66]	Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
[02:18.08]	My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
[02:20.36]	With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
[02:22.78]	For what he did before Corioli, call him,
[02:24.88]	With all the applause and clamour of the host,
[02:27.25]	CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
[02:28.89]	The addition nobly ever!
[02:30.26]	[Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums]
[02:30.81]All	Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
[02:32.22]CORIOLANUS	I will go wash;
[02:33.18]	And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
[02:35.46]	Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
[02:37.65]	I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
[02:39.97]	To undercrest your good addition
[02:41.75]	To the fairness of my power.
[02:43.30]COMINIUS	So, to our tent;
[02:44.26]	Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
[02:46.36]	To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
[02:48.50]	Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
[02:50.46]	The best, with whom we may articulate,
[02:52.42]	For their own good and ours.
[02:53.97]LARTIUS	I shall, my lord.
[02:54.97]CORIOLANUS	The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
[02:56.94]	Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
[02:59.22]	Of my lord general.
[03:00.36]COMINIUS	Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
[03:01.86]CORIOLANUS	I sometime lay here in Corioli
[03:03.55]	At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
[03:05.65]	He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
[03:07.47]	But then Aufidius was within my view,
[03:09.43]	And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
[03:11.71]	To give my poor host freedom.
[03:13.31]COMINIUS	O, well begg'd!
[03:14.22]	Were he the butcher of my son, he should
[03:16.32]	Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
[03:18.46]LARTIUS	Marcius, his name?
[03:19.51]CORIOLANUS	By Jupiter! forgot.
[03:20.60]	I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
[03:22.43]	Have we no wine here?
[03:23.66]COMINIUS	Go we to our tent:
[03:24.75]	The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
[03:26.94]	It should be look'd to: come.
[03:28.49]	[Exeunt]
