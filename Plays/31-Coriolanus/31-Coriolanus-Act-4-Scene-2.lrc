[00:00.40]	[The same. A street near the gate.,]
[00:01.22]	[Enter SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and an AEdile]
[00:02.03]SICINIUS	Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
[00:05.76]	The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
[00:09.29]	In his behalf.
[00:10.65]BRUTUS	Now we have shown our power,
[00:12.96]	Let us seem humbler after it is done
[00:15.88]	Than when it was a-doing.
[00:17.98]SICINIUS	Bid them home:
[00:19.34]	Say their great enemy is gone, and they
[00:22.39]	Stand in their ancient strength.
[00:24.97]BRUTUS	Dismiss them home.
[00:26.60]	[Exit AEdile]
[00:27.42]	Here comes his mother.
[00:29.32]SICINIUS	Let's not meet her.
[00:31.01]BRUTUS	Why?
[00:31.69]SICINIUS	They say she's mad.
[00:33.39]BRUTUS	They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
[00:36.78]	[Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS]
[00:37.60]VOLUMNIA	O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
[00:41.19]	Requite your love!
[00:42.82]MENENIUS	Peace, peace; be not so loud.
[00:45.06]VOLUMNIA	If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
[00:48.46]	Nay, and you shall hear some.
[00:50.76]	[To BRUTUS]
[00:51.58]	Will you be gone?
[00:53.14]VIRGILIA	[To SICINIUS] You shall stay too: I would I had the power
[00:56.87]	To say so to my husband.
[00:58.91]SICINIUS	Are you mankind?
[01:00.40]VOLUMNIA	Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
[01:03.73]	Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
[01:07.05]	To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
[01:10.58]	Than thou hast spoken words?
[01:12.89]SICINIUS	O blessed heavens!
[01:14.52]VOLUMNIA	More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
[01:17.84]	And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
[01:21.44]	Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
[01:24.77]	Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
[01:27.89]	His good sword in his hand.
[01:30.13]SICINIUS	What then?
[01:31.21]VIRGILIA	What then!
[01:32.30]	He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
[01:35.08]VOLUMNIA	Bastards and all.
[01:36.64]	Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
[01:40.24]MENENIUS	Come, come, peace.
[01:41.73]SICINIUS	I would he had continued to his country
[01:44.86]	As he began, and not unknit himself
[01:47.64]	The noble knot he made.
[01:49.61]BRUTUS	I would he had.
[01:51.03]VOLUMNIA	'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
[01:54.43]	Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
[01:57.68]	As I can of those mysteries which heaven
[02:00.87]	Will not have earth to know.
[02:03.18]BRUTUS	Pray, let us go.
[02:04.61]VOLUMNIA	Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
[02:06.78]	You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
[02:10.44]	As far as doth the Capitol exceed
[02:13.16]	The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
[02:16.28]	This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
[02:19.47]	Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
[02:22.80]BRUTUS	Well, well, we'll leave you.
[02:24.97]SICINIUS	Why stay we to be baited
[02:27.07]	With one that wants her wits?
[02:29.45]VOLUMNIA	Take my prayers with you.
[02:31.55]	[Exeunt Tribunes]
[02:32.37]	I would the gods had nothing else to do
[02:35.49]	But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
[02:38.68]	But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
[02:41.80]	Of what lies heavy to't.
[02:43.84]MENENIUS	You have told them home;
[02:45.87]	And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
[02:49.67]VOLUMNIA	Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
[02:52.39]	And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
[02:55.99]	Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
[02:59.31]	In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
[03:02.03]MENENIUS	Fie, fie, fie!
[03:03.25]	[Exeunt]
