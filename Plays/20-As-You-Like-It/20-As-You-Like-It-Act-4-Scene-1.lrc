[00:00.38] [The forest.,]
[00:01.15] [Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES]
[00:01.92]JAQUES I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.
[00:05.15]ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow.
[00:07.14]JAQUES I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
[00:11.67]ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
[00:14.46] fellows and betray themselves to every modern
[00:17.00] censure worse than drunkards.
[00:18.98]JAQUES Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
[00:23.03]ROSALIND Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
[00:26.01]JAQUES I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
[00:29.00] emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
[00:32.40] nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
[00:34.71] soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
[00:37.01] which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
[00:39.81] the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
[00:44.09] melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
[00:47.94] extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
[00:51.11] contemplation of my travels, in which my often
[00:54.47] rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
[00:59.49]ROSALIND A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
[01:03.40] be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
[01:07.94] other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
[01:10.98] nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
[01:15.27]JAQUES Yes, I have gained my experience.
[01:20.36]ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
[01:23.65] a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
[01:25.94] sad; and to travel for it too!
[01:28.69] [Enter ORLANDO]
[01:29.21]ORLANDO Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
[01:31.85]JAQUES Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
[01:34.59] [Exit]
[01:35.09]ROSALIND Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
[01:39.24] wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
[01:42.28] own country, be out of love with your nativity and
[01:45.39] almost chide God for making you that countenance you
[01:48.37] are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
[01:50.67] gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
[01:56.39] all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
[01:59.43] another trick, never come in my sight more.
[02:01.91]ORLANDO My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
[02:04.76]ROSALIND Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
[02:09.88] divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
[02:13.08] a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
[02:15.14] affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
[02:17.49] hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
[02:20.23] him heart-whole.
[02:21.54]ORLANDO Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
[02:23.15]ROSALIND Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
[02:25.89] had as lief be wooed of a snail.
[02:27.88]ORLANDO Of a snail?
[02:28.98]ROSALIND Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
[02:33.34] carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
[02:35.57] I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
[02:38.31] his destiny with him.
[02:40.05]ORLANDO What's that?
[02:40.73]ROSALIND Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
[02:43.15] beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
[02:46.01] his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
[02:48.49]ORLANDO Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
[02:51.35]ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind.
[02:53.28]CELIA It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
[02:56.69] Rosalind of a better leer than you.
[02:58.43]ROSALIND Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
[03:04.00] humour and like enough to consent. What would you
[03:06.32] say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
[03:09.80]ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke.
[03:11.35]ROSALIND Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
[03:14.71] gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
[03:16.52] occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
[03:19.12] out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
[03:21.72] warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
[03:24.39]ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied?
[03:25.81]ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
[03:27.93]ORLANDO Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
[03:30.97]ROSALIND Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
[03:33.58] I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
[03:35.70]ORLANDO What, of my suit?
[03:36.68]ROSALIND Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
[03:38.67] Am not I your Rosalind?
[03:41.22]ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
[03:44.64] talking of her.
[03:45.69]ROSALIND Well in her person I say I will not have you.
[03:47.36]ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die.
[03:48.93]ROSALIND No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
[03:53.76] almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
[03:56.63] there was not any man died in his own person,
[03:59.24] videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
[04:02.59] dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
[04:06.12] could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
[04:08.80] of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
[04:13.08] year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
[04:16.44] for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
[04:20.23] but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
[04:22.78] taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
[04:25.63] coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
[04:29.40] But these are all lies: men have died from time to
[04:34.50] time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
[04:37.31]ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
[04:39.91] for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
[04:42.71]ROSALIND By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
[04:47.23] I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
[04:51.90] disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
[04:54.14] it.
[04:55.03]ORLANDO Then love me, Rosalind.
[04:56.93]ROSALIND Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
[05:00.72]ORLANDO And wilt thou have me?
[05:01.77]ROSALIND Ay, and twenty such.
[05:03.26]ORLANDO What sayest thou?
[05:04.32]ROSALIND Are you not good?
[05:05.20]ORLANDO I hope so.
[05:06.35]ROSALIND Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
[05:08.79] Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
[05:12.02] Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?
[05:15.38]ORLANDO Pray thee, marry us.
[05:16.93]CELIA I cannot say the words.
[05:19.04]ROSALIND You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'
[05:20.78]CELIA Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
[05:27.49]ORLANDO I will.
[05:28.61]ROSALIND Ay, but when?
[05:29.85]ORLANDO Why now; as fast as she can marry us.
[05:30.96]ROSALIND Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
[05:35.75]ORLANDO I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
[05:41.71]ROSALIND I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
[05:44.94] thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
[05:49.85] before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
[05:52.33] runs before her actions.
[05:53.70]ORLANDO So do all thoughts; they are winged.
[05:55.25]ROSALIND Now tell me how long you would have her after you
[05:58.36] have possessed her.
[05:59.66]ORLANDO For ever and a day.
[06:01.92]ROSALIND Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
[06:04.87] men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
[06:09.10] maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
[06:11.71] changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
[06:15.62] of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
[06:18.69] more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
[06:21.95] new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
[06:26.67] than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
[06:30.77] in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
[06:33.20] disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
[06:36.80] that when thou art inclined to sleep.
[06:38.36]ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so?
[06:39.66]ROSALIND By my life, she will do as I do.
[06:41.14]ORLANDO O, but she is wise.
[06:42.95]ROSALIND Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
[06:45.75] wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
[06:48.98] wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
[06:51.52] 'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
[06:53.63] with the smoke out at the chimney.
[06:56.17]ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
[06:59.17] 'Wit, whither wilt?'
[07:00.34]ROSALIND Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
[07:02.63] your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
[07:04.62]ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
[07:08.11]ROSALIND Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
[07:11.25] never take her without her answer, unless you take
[07:13.63] her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
[07:16.30] make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
[07:19.22] never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
[07:21.58] it like a fool!
[07:22.57]ORLANDO For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
[07:24.81]ROSALIND Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
[07:27.61]ORLANDO I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
[07:31.58] will be with thee again.
[07:32.57]ROSALIND Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
[07:36.42] would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
[07:38.28] thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
[07:41.02] won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
[07:45.99] death! Two o'clock is your hour?
[07:48.96]ORLANDO Ay, sweet Rosalind.
[07:51.14]ROSALIND By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
[07:53.62] me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
[07:55.87] if you break one jot of your promise or come one
[07:59.41] minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
[08:02.32] pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
[08:05.74] and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
[08:08.97] may be chosen out of the gross band of the
[08:11.08] unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
[08:14.13] your promise.
[08:15.18]ORLANDO With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
[08:18.56] Rosalind: so adieu.
[08:19.18]ROSALIND Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
[08:26.92] offenders, and let Time try: adieu.
[08:33.45] [Exit ORLANDO]
[08:34.62]CELIA You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
[08:45.56] we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
[08:48.22] head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
[08:50.89] her own nest.
[08:52.07]ROSALIND O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
[08:55.17] didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
[08:59.90] it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
[09:05.48] bottom, like the bay of Portugal.
[09:10.08]CELIA Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
[09:14.05] affection in, it runs out.
[09:16.11]ROSALIND No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
[09:20.95] of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
[09:24.25] that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
[09:27.72] because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
[09:31.32] am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
[09:38.59] of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
[09:43.87] sigh till he come.
[09:47.30]CELIA And I'll sleep.
