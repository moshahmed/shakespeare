[00:00.37]JAQUES I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
[00:04.07] as lief have been myself alone.
[00:05.00]ORLANDO And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
[00:09.10] too for your society.
[00:10.65]JAQUES God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
[00:13.45]ORLANDO I do desire we may be better strangers.
[00:16.50]JAQUES I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
[00:19.04] love-songs in their barks.
[00:20.96]ORLANDO I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
[00:24.13] them ill-favouredly.
[00:25.18]JAQUES Rosalind is your love's name?
[00:27.54]ORLANDO Yes, just.
[00:29.41]JAQUES I do not like her name.
[00:30.59]ORLANDO There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
[00:33.27] christened.
[00:34.07]JAQUES What stature is she of?
[00:35.19]ORLANDO Just as high as my heart.
[00:37.61]JAQUES You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
[00:40.78] acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
[00:43.51] out of rings?
[00:44.75]ORLANDO Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
[00:47.98] whence you have studied your questions.
[00:49.60]JAQUES You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
[00:52.33] Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
[00:57.05] we two will rail against our mistress the world and
[01:00.65] all our misery.
[01:02.21]ORLANDO I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
[01:04.81] against whom I know most faults.
[01:07.05]JAQUES The worst fault you have is to be in love.
[01:09.17]ORLANDO 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
[01:11.72] I am weary of you.
[01:14.62]JAQUES By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
[01:16.99] you.
[01:17.92]ORLANDO He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
[01:20.22] shall see him.
[01:21.52]JAQUES There I shall see mine own figure.
[01:23.13]ORLANDO Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
[01:24.99]JAQUES I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
[01:27.73] Signior Love.
[01:29.47]ORLANDO I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
[01:33.39] Melancholy.
[01:34.19] [Exit JAQUES]
[01:34.75]ROSALIND [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucy
[01:37.79] lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
[01:40.55] Do you hear, forester?
[01:42.70]ORLANDO Very well: what would you?
[01:44.75]ROSALIND I pray you, what is't o'clock?
[01:47.97]ORLANDO You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
[01:51.08] in the forest.
[01:52.38]ROSALIND Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
[01:54.74] sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
[01:57.42] detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
[02:00.16]ORLANDO And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
[02:02.71] been as proper?
[02:03.50]ROSALIND By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
[02:06.30] divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
[02:09.53] withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
[02:11.59] withal and who he stands still withal.
[02:13.87]ORLANDO I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
[02:16.48]ROSALIND Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
[02:20.15] contract of her marriage and the day it is
[02:22.46] solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
[02:24.68] Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
[02:27.48] seven year.
[02:28.66]ORLANDO Who ambles Time withal?
[02:30.39]ROSALIND With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
[02:33.95] hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
[02:36.11] he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
[02:38.66] he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
[02:41.70] and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
[02:44.64] of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
[02:49.11]ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal?
[02:50.71]ROSALIND With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
[02:53.37] softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
[02:56.42]ORLANDO Who stays it still withal?
[02:58.53]ROSALIND With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
[03:02.58] term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
[03:06.17]ORLANDO Where dwell you, pretty youth?
[03:09.84]ROSALIND With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
[03:13.31] skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
[03:15.73]ORLANDO Are you native of this place?
[03:17.47]ROSALIND As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
[03:20.14]ORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could
[03:22.39] purchase in so removed a dwelling.
[03:24.19]ROSALIND I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
[03:27.23] religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
[03:30.98] in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
[03:34.74] too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
[03:37.35] him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
[03:40.70] I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
[03:43.25] giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
[03:45.98] whole sex withal.
[03:47.41]ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
[03:51.70] laid to the charge of women?
[03:53.18]ROSALIND There were none principal; they were all like one
[03:55.92] another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
[03:58.04] monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
[04:01.01]ORLANDO I prithee, recount some of them.
[04:03.31]ROSALIND No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
[04:06.40] are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
[04:10.16] abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
[04:14.56] their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
[04:17.47] on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
[04:20.46] Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
[04:24.13] give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
[04:26.42] quotidian of love upon him.
[04:28.66]ORLANDO I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
[04:32.69] your remedy.
[04:34.24]ROSALIND There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
[04:37.78] taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
[04:40.02] of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
[04:42.87]ORLANDO What were his marks?
[04:44.24]ROSALIND A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
[04:50.57] sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
[04:54.86] spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
[04:58.60] which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
[05:01.09] simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
[05:03.12] revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
[05:07.35] bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
[05:09.76] untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
[05:11.57] careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
[05:15.06] are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
[05:18.15] loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
[05:20.83]ORLANDO Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
[05:24.00]ROSALIND Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
[05:27.29] love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
[05:28.28] do than to confess she does: that is one of the
[05:32.56] points in the which women still give the lie to
[05:34.31] their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
[05:36.80] that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
[05:39.33] is so admired?
[05:40.64]ORLANDO I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
[05:43.61] Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
[05:47.28]ROSALIND But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
[05:49.53]ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
[05:52.49]ROSALIND Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
[05:56.10] as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
[05:59.51] the reason why they are not so punished and cured
[06:01.57] is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
[06:03.99] are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
[06:09.08]ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so?
[06:11.20]ROSALIND Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
[06:17.54] his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
[06:22.49] woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
[06:25.66] youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
[06:29.14] and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
[06:34.06] inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
[06:36.67] passion something and for no passion truly any
[06:38.27] thing, as boys and women are for the most part
[06:40.88] cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
[06:44.37] him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
[06:47.33] for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
[06:49.76] from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
[06:52.50] madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
[06:55.29] the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
[06:58.96] And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
[07:02.69] me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
[07:06.93] heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
[07:12.18]ORLANDO I would not be cured, youth.
[07:15.10]ROSALIND I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
[07:18.84] and come every day to my cote and woo me.
[07:24.67]ORLANDO Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
[07:30.26] where it is.
[07:31.12]ROSALIND Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
[07:33.55] you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
[07:35.42] Will you go?
[07:37.52]ORLANDO With all my heart, good youth.
[07:39.14]ROSALIND Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?
