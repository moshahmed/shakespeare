[00:02.20] [Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters]
[00:03.68]JAQUES Which is he that killed the deer?
[00:03.70]A Lord Sir, it was I.
[00:04.81]JAQUES Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
[00:07.14] conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
[00:09.47] horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
[00:12.95] you no song, forester, for this purpose?
[00:15.18]Forester Yes, sir.
[00:15.93]JAQUES Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
[00:18.23] make noise enough.
[00:19.47] SONG.
[00:24.28] What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
[00:25.95] His leather skin and horns to wear.
[00:28.19] Then sing him home;
[00:30.11] Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
[00:32.54] It was a crest ere thou wast born:
[00:34.65] Thy father's father wore it,
[00:36.82] And thy father bore it:
[00:39.31] The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
[00:42.98] Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
[00:47.38] What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
[00:50.12] His leather skin and horns to wear.
[00:52.23] Then sing him home;
[00:54.42] Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
[00:56.53] It was a crest ere thou wast born:
[00:58.68] Thy father's father wore it,
[01:00.55] And thy father bore it:
[01:02.73] The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
[01:06.65] Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
[01:10.73] The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
[01:15.21] Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
