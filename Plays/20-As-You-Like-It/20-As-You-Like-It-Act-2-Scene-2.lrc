[00:00.37] [A room in the palace.,]
[00:01.13] [Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords]
[00:01.89]DUKE FREDERICK Can it be possible that no man saw them?
[00:04.79] It cannot be: some villains of my court
[00:06.52] Are of consent and sufferance in this.
[00:08.70]First Lord I cannot hear of any that did see her.
[00:10.75] The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
[00:12.55] Saw her abed, and in the morning early
[00:14.42] They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
[00:16.22]Second Lord My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
[00:18.64] Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
[00:20.69] Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
[00:23.42] Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
[00:25.34] Your daughter and her cousin much commend
[00:27.83] The parts and graces of the wrestler
[00:29.82] That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
[00:32.54] And she believes, wherever they are gone,
[00:34.73] That youth is surely in their company.
[00:37.28]DUKE FREDERICK Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
[00:39.82] If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
[00:42.17] I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
[00:47.15] And let not search and inquisition quail
[00:49.95] To bring again these foolish runaways.
[00:53.36] [Exeunt]
