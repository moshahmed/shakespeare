[00:00.40] [Another part of the forest.,] [Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]
[00:02.01]SILVIUS Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
[00:04.98] Say that you love me not, but say not so
[00:07.97] In bitterness. The common executioner,
[00:10.64] Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
[00:13.25] Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
[00:15.23] But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
[00:18.46] Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
[00:21.26] [Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind]
[00:21.69]PHEBE I would not be thy executioner:
[00:23.18] I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
[00:25.98] Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
[00:29.39] 'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
[00:32.44] That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
[00:35.24] Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
[00:37.47] Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
[00:40.14] Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
[00:44.36] And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
[00:47.91] Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
[00:52.44] Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
[00:59.60] Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
[01:01.88] Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
[01:04.93] Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
[01:07.28] Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
[01:10.09] The cicatrice and capable impressure
[01:12.27] Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
[01:15.12] Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
[01:18.04] Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
[01:20.65] That can do hurt.
[01:22.16]SILVIUS O dear Phebe,
[01:23.44] If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
[01:25.11] You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
[01:27.71] Then shall you know the wounds invisible
[01:30.02] That love's keen arrows make.
[01:32.12]PHEBE But till that time
[01:33.34] Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
[01:36.23] Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
[01:38.52] As till that time I shall not pity thee.
[01:40.95]ROSALIND And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
[01:44.68] That you insult, exult, and all at once,
[01:47.23] Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
[01:49.59] As, by my faith, I see no more in you
[01:51.89] Than without candle may go dark to bed--
[01:53.86] Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
[01:56.73] Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
[02:02.63] I see no more in you than in the ordinary
[02:05.36] Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
[02:07.90] I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
[02:09.59] No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
[02:14.23] 'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
[02:17.73] Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
[02:19.95] That can entame my spirits to your worship.
[02:22.39] You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
[02:27.22] Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
[02:30.27] You are a thousand times a properer man
[02:32.94] Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
[02:35.36] That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
[02:38.28] 'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
[02:41.51] And out of you she sees herself more proper
[02:43.68] Than any of her lineaments can show her.
[02:46.54] But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
[02:51.32] And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
[02:54.67] For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
[02:57.22] Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
[03:00.02] Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
[03:03.56] Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
[03:06.73] So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.
[03:09.02]PHEBE Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
[03:12.69] I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
[03:15.91]ROSALIND He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
[03:20.45] fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
[03:24.55] she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
[03:28.15] with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
[03:31.44]PHEBE For no ill will I bear you.
[03:33.92]ROSALIND I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
[03:36.23] For I am falser than vows made in wine:
[03:38.78] Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
[03:44.10] 'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
[03:46.35] Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
[03:48.96] Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
[03:51.51] And be not proud: though all the world could see,
[03:54.48] None could be so abused in sight as he.
[03:57.41] Come, to our flock.
[04:00.20] [Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN]
[04:00.82]PHEBE Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
[04:06.10] 'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'
[04:11.07]SILVIUS Sweet Phebe,--
[04:12.38]PHEBE Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?
[04:15.41]SILVIUS Sweet Phebe, pity me.
[04:19.95]PHEBE Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
[04:23.43]SILVIUS Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
[04:25.60] If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
[04:28.15] By giving love your sorrow and my grief
[04:30.57] Were both extermined.
[04:32.18]PHEBE Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
[04:34.41]SILVIUS I would have you.
[04:35.98]PHEBE Why, that were covetousness.
[04:37.97] Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
[04:40.44] And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
[04:42.93] But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
[04:46.66] Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
[04:49.79] I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
[04:52.39] But do not look for further recompense
[04:54.98] Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
[04:57.09]SILVIUS So holy and so perfect is my love,
[04:59.63] And I in such a poverty of grace,
[05:01.69] That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
[05:03.86] To glean the broken ears after the man
[05:06.22] That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
[05:09.33] A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.
[05:11.75]PHEBE Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
[05:15.54]SILVIUS Not very well, but I have met him oft;
[05:19.00] And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
[05:20.57] That the old carlot once was master of.
[05:22.62]PHEBE Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
[05:26.10] 'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
[05:30.07] But what care I for words? yet words do well
[05:34.73] When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
[05:37.34] It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
[05:42.18] But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
[05:47.59] He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
[05:51.31] Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
[05:53.98] Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
[05:56.09] He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
[06:00.69] His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
[06:07.21] There was a pretty redness in his lip,
[06:09.88] A little riper and more lusty red
[06:12.61] Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
[06:15.79] Between the constant red and mingled damask.
[06:20.15] There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
[06:22.98] In parcels as I did, would have gone near
[06:25.16] To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
[06:27.14] I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
[06:31.06] I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
[06:33.35] For what had he to do to chide at me?
[06:36.31] He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
[06:41.19] And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
[06:44.79] I marvel why I answer'd not again:
[06:47.77] But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
[06:50.68] I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
[06:54.60] And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?
[06:56.40]SILVIUS Phebe, with all my heart.
[06:58.63]PHEBE I'll write it straight;
[07:00.25] The matter's in my head and in my heart:
[07:04.37] I will be bitter with him and passing short.
[07:06.84] Go with me, Silvius.
