[00:00.41]	[OLIVIA's garden.,]
[00:01.25]	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN]
[00:02.09]SIR TOBY BELCH	Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
[00:04.53]FABIAN	Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
[00:08.30]	let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
[00:11.64]SIR TOBY BELCH	Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
[00:15.34]	rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
[00:19.11]FABIAN	I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
[00:22.81]	favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
[00:26.43]SIR TOBY BELCH	To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will
[00:30.41]	fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?
[00:34.18]SIR ANDREW	An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
[00:37.18]SIR TOBY BELCH	Here comes the little villain.
[00:39.69]	[Enter MARIA]
[00:40.53]	How now, my metal of India!
[00:42.76]MARIA	Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
[00:46.39]	coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
[00:50.08]	sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
[00:54.13]	hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
[00:57.83]	know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
[01:01.87]	him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,
[01:05.64]	[Throws down a letter]
[01:06.48]	for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
[01:11.01]	[Exit]
[01:11.85]	[Enter MALVOLIO]
[01:12.68]MALVOLIO	'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
[01:16.38]	me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
[01:20.36]	thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
[01:24.19]	of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
[01:28.03]	exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
[01:32.01]	What should I think on't?
[01:34.17]SIR TOBY BELCH	Here's an overweening rogue!
[01:36.54]FABIAN	O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
[01:40.24]	of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
[01:43.80]SIR ANDREW	'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
[01:46.52]SIR TOBY BELCH	Peace, I say.
[01:47.77]MALVOLIO	To be Count Malvolio!
[01:49.66]SIR TOBY BELCH	Ah, rogue!
[01:50.70]SIR ANDREW	Pistol him, pistol him.
[01:52.66]SIR TOBY BELCH	Peace, peace!
[01:53.91]MALVOLIO	There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
[01:57.61]	married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
[02:00.47]SIR ANDREW	Fie on him, Jezebel!
[02:02.21]FABIAN	O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
[02:05.14]	imagination blows him.
[02:07.10]MALVOLIO	Having been three months married to her, sitting in
[02:11.07]	my state,--
[02:12.12]SIR TOBY BELCH	O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
[02:15.33]MALVOLIO	Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
[02:19.30]	gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
[02:23.21]	Olivia sleeping,--
[02:24.75]SIR TOBY BELCH	Fire and brimstone!
[02:26.49]FABIAN	O, peace, peace!
[02:27.89]MALVOLIO	And then to have the humour of state; and after a
[02:31.72]	demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
[02:35.42]	place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
[02:39.26]	kinsman Toby,--
[02:40.58]SIR TOBY BELCH	Bolts and shackles!
[02:42.33]FABIAN	O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
[02:44.70]MALVOLIO	Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
[02:48.39]	out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
[02:52.23]	up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
[02:55.86]	approaches; courtesies there to me,--
[02:58.65]SIR TOBY BELCH	Shall this fellow live?
[03:00.67]FABIAN	Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
[03:05.00]MALVOLIO	I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
[03:08.97]	smile with an austere regard of control,--
[03:12.18]SIR TOBY BELCH	And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
[03:16.09]MALVOLIO	Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
[03:19.93]	your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--
[03:23.55]SIR TOBY BELCH	What, what?
[03:24.67]MALVOLIO	'You must amend your drunkenness.'
[03:27.32]SIR TOBY BELCH	Out, scab!
[03:28.37]FABIAN	Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
[03:32.13]MALVOLIO	'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
[03:35.97]	a foolish knight,'--
[03:37.57]SIR ANDREW	That's me, I warrant you.
[03:39.67]MALVOLIO	'One Sir Andrew,'--
[03:41.13]SIR ANDREW	I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
[03:44.27]MALVOLIO	What employment have we here?
[03:46.71]	[Taking up the letter]
[03:47.55]FABIAN	Now is the woodcock near the gin.
[03:50.27]SIR TOBY BELCH	O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
[03:54.18]	aloud to him!
[03:55.50]MALVOLIO	By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
[03:59.20]	very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
[04:03.25]	great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
[04:07.08]SIR ANDREW	Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?
[04:10.08]MALVOLIO	[Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
[04:13.71]	wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
[04:17.06]	Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
[04:21.04]	uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
[04:24.80]FABIAN	This wins him, liver and all.
[04:27.17]MALVOLIO	[Reads]
[04:28.01]	Jove knows I love: But who?
[04:30.24]	Lips, do not move;
[04:31.85]	No man must know.
[04:33.45]	'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
[04:36.80]	altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
[04:40.22]	thee, Malvolio?
[04:41.61]SIR TOBY BELCH	Marry, hang thee, brock!
[04:43.57]MALVOLIO	[Reads]
[04:44.40]	I may command where I adore;
[04:46.78]	But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
[04:49.50]	With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
[04:52.78]	M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.
[04:55.01]FABIAN	A fustian riddle!
[04:56.61]SIR TOBY BELCH	Excellent wench, say I.
[04:58.57]MALVOLIO	'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
[05:02.05]	me see, let me see, let me see.
[05:04.50]FABIAN	What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
[05:07.63]SIR TOBY BELCH	And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
[05:11.19]MALVOLIO	'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
[05:14.96]	me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
[05:18.31]	evident to any formal capacity; there is no
[05:21.73]	obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
[05:25.21]	that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
[05:29.19]	that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
[05:32.61]	I,--
[05:33.17]SIR TOBY BELCH	O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.
[05:36.65]FABIAN	Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
[05:40.70]	rank as a fox.
[05:42.10]MALVOLIO	M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
[05:45.10]FABIAN	Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
[05:48.72]	excellent at faults.
[05:50.54]MALVOLIO	M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;
[05:54.30]	that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
[05:58.63]FABIAN	And O shall end, I hope.
[06:00.65]SIR TOBY BELCH	Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!
[06:03.93]MALVOLIO	And then I comes behind.
[06:06.02]FABIAN	Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
[06:09.72]	more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
[06:13.70]	you.
[06:14.39]MALVOLIO	M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
[06:18.23]	yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
[06:22.14]	every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
[06:25.83]	here follows prose.
[06:27.58]	[Reads]
[06:28.42]	'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
[06:32.25]	am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
[06:36.16]	are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
[06:39.86]	have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
[06:43.41]	their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
[06:47.32]	and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
[06:51.16]	cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
[06:54.58]	opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
[06:58.34]	thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
[07:02.39]	the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
[07:06.09]	that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
[07:09.78]	yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
[07:13.34]	cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
[07:16.90]	made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
[07:20.74]	thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
[07:24.50]	not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
[07:28.20]	She that would alter services with thee,
[07:31.41]	[THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY?]
[07:32.25]	Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
[07:36.15]	open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
[07:39.99]	I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
[07:43.55]	acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
[07:47.38]	I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
[07:51.22]	me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
[07:55.06]	loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
[07:58.82]	late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
[08:02.59]	and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
[08:06.43]	with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
[08:10.47]	of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
[08:14.31]	be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
[08:17.59]	cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
[08:21.50]	on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
[08:25.12]	postscript.
[08:26.31]	[Reads]
[08:27.15]	'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
[08:30.91]	entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
[08:34.82]	thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
[08:38.31]	presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
[08:41.87]	Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
[08:45.14]	everything that thou wilt have me.
[08:47.93]	[Exit]
[08:48.77]FABIAN	I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
[08:52.82]	of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
[08:55.96]SIR TOBY BELCH	I could marry this wench for this device.
[08:59.24]SIR ANDREW	So could I too.
[09:00.70]SIR TOBY BELCH	And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
[09:04.89]SIR ANDREW	Nor I neither.
[09:06.28]FABIAN	Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
[09:09.00]	[Re-enter MARIA]
[09:09.84]SIR TOBY BELCH	Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
[09:12.56]SIR ANDREW	Or o' mine either?
[09:14.16]SIR TOBY BELCH	Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
[09:18.14]	bond-slave?
[09:19.33]SIR ANDREW	I' faith, or I either?
[09:21.14]SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
[09:24.91]	the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
[09:28.33]MARIA	Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
[09:31.46]SIR TOBY BELCH	Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
[09:34.05]MARIA	If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
[09:37.95]	his first approach before my lady: he will come to
[09:41.86]	her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
[09:45.42]	abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
[09:49.18]	and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
[09:52.95]	unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
[09:56.86]	melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
[10:00.69]	into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
[10:04.60]	me.
[10:05.23]SIR TOBY BELCH	To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
[10:09.55]SIR ANDREW	I'll make one too.
[10:11.23]	[Exeunt]
